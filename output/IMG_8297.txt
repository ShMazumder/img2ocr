lasting neutralizing immunity against MERS spike<br/>pseudotyped virus, characterized by the induction of<br/>systemic IgG, secretory IgA, and lung-resident<br/>memory T-cell responses (177). Immunoinformatics<br/>methods have been employed for the genome-wide<br/>screening of potential vaccine targets among the<br/>different immunogens of MERS-CoV (178). The N<br/>protein and the potential B-cell epitopes of MERS-<br/>CoV E_ protein have beenâ€™ suggested as<br/>immunoprotective targets inducing both T-cell and<br/>neutralizing antibody responses (178, 179).<br/><br/>The collaborative effort of the researchers of<br/>Rocky Mountain Laboratories and Oxford University<br/>is designing a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored<br/>vaccine to counter COVID-19 (180). The Coalition<br/>for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has<br/>initiated three programs to design SARS-CoV-2<br/>vaccines (181). CEPI has a collaborative project with<br/>Inovio for designing a MERS-CoV DNA vaccine<br/>that could potentiate effective immunity. CEPI and<br/>the University of Queensland are designing a<br/>molecular clamp vaccine platform for MERS-CoV<br/>and other pathogens, which could assist in the easier<br/>identification of antigens by the immune system<br/>(181). CEPT has also funded Moderna to develon a
