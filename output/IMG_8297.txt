lasting neutralizing immunity against MERS spike pseudotyped virus, characterized by the induction of systemic IgG, secretory IgA, and lung-resident memory T-cell responses (177). Immunoinformatics methods have been employed for the genome-wide screening of potential vaccine targets among the different immunogens of MERS-CoV (178). The N protein and the potential B-cell epitopes of MERS- CoV E_ protein have beenâ€™ suggested as immunoprotective targets inducing both T-cell and neutralizing antibody responses (178, 179).<br/>The collaborative effort of the researchers of Rocky Mountain Laboratories and Oxford University is designing a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine to counter COVID-19 (180). The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has initiated three programs to design SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (181). CEPI has a collaborative project with Inovio for designing a MERS-CoV DNA vaccine that could potentiate effective immunity. CEPI and the University of Queensland are designing a molecular clamp vaccine platform for MERS-CoV and other pathogens, which could assist in the easier identification of antigens by the immune system (181). CEPT has also funded Moderna to develon a
