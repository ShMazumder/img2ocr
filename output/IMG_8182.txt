from incubation period to infection takes an<br/>average of 12.5 days.*°<br/><br/>6 CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS<br/><br/>The symptoms of COVID-19 remain very similar<br/>to those of the other respiratory epidemics in<br/>the past, which include SARS and MERS, but<br/>here the range of symptoms includes mild<br/>rhinitis to septic shock. Some intestinal<br/>disturbances were reported with the other<br/>epidemics, but COVID-19 was devoid of such<br/>symptoms. When examined, unilateral or<br/>bilateral involvement compatible with viral<br/>pneumonia is observed in the patients, and<br/>bilateral multiple lobular and sub-segmental<br/>consolidation areas were observed in patients<br/>hospitalised in the intensive care unit.<br/>Comorbid patients showed a more severe<br/>clinical course than predicted from previous<br/>epidemics. Diagnosis of COVID-19 includes the<br/>complete history of travel and touch, with<br/>laboratory testing. It is more preferable to<br/>choose serological screening, which can help to<br/>analyse even the asymptomatic infections;<br/>several serological tests are in progress for<br/>SARS-CoV-2. 1 2°
