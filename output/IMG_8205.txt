storage<br/><br/>A Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab<br/>should be collected using Dacron or polyester<br/>flocked swabs. It should be transported to the<br/>laboratory at a temperature of 4°C and stored<br/>in the laboratory between 4 and -70°C on the<br/>basis of the number of days and, in order to<br/>increase the viral load, both nasopharyngeal<br/>and oropharyngeal swabs should be placed in<br/>the same tube. Bronchoalveolar lavage and<br/>nasopharyngeal aspirate should be collected in<br/>a sterile container and transported similarly to<br/>the laboratory by maintain a temperature of<br/>4°C.<br/><br/>Sputum samples, especially from the lower<br/>respiratory tract, should be collected with the<br/>help of a sterile container and stored, whereas<br/>tissue from a biopsy or autopsy should be<br/>collected using a sterile container along with<br/>saline. However, both should be stored in the<br/>laboratory at a temperature that ranges<br/>between 4 and -70°C. Whole blood for<br/>detecting the antigen, particularly in the first<br/>week of illness, should be collected ina<br/>collecting tube and stored in the laboratory<br/>between 4 and -70°C. Urine samples must also<br/>be collected using a sterile container and stored
