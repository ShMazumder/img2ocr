plasma, which has limited availability and cannot be<br/>amplified, monoclonal antibodies can be developed in<br/>larger quantities to meet clinical requirements. Hence,<br/>they provide the possibility for the treatment and pre-<br/>vention of COVID-19. The neutralizing epitopes of<br/>these monoclonal antibodies also offer important infor-<br/>mation for vaccine design. However, the high cost and<br/>limited capacity of manufacturing, as well as the prob-<br/>lem of bioavailability, may restrict the wide application<br/>of monoclonal antibody therapy.<br/><br/>Vaccines<br/><br/>Vaccination is the most effective method for a long-term<br/>strategy for prevention and control of COVID-19 in<br/>the future. Many different vaccine platforms against<br/>SARS-CoV-2 are in development, the strategies of which<br/>include recombinant vectors, DNA, mRNA in lipid nano-<br/>particles, inactivated viruses, live attenuated viruses and<br/>protein subunits'*-'°'. As of 2 October 2020, ~174 vac-<br/>cine candidates for COVID-19 had been reported<br/>and 51 were in human clinical trials (COVID-19<br/>vaccine and therapeutics tracker). Many of these vac-<br/>cine candidates are in phase II testing, and some have<br/>already advanced to phase III trials. A randomize4<br/>double-blinded phase II trial of an adenovirus type<br/>vectored vaccine expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein,<br/>developed by CanSino Biologicals and the Academy of<br/>Military Medical Sciences of China, was conducted in<br/>603 adult volunteers in Wuhan. The vaccine has proved<br/>to be safe and induced considerable humoral and cel-<br/>lular immune response in most recipients after a single<br/>immunization’. Another vectored vaccine, ChAdOx1,
