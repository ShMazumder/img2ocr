detectable serum SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibodies<br/>(170). Antigenic determinant sites present over S and<br/>N_ structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 can be<br/>explored as suitable vaccine candidates (294). In the<br/>Asian population, S, E, M, and N proteins of SARS-<br/>CoV-2 are being targeted for developing subunit<br/>vaccines against COVID-19 (295).<br/><br/>The identification of the immunodominant region<br/>among the subunits and domains of S protein is<br/>critical for developing an effective vaccine against<br/>the coronavirus. The C-terminal domain of the S1<br/>subunit is considered the immunodominant region of<br/>the porcine deltacoronavirus S_ protein (171).<br/>Similarly, further investigations are needed to<br/>determine the immunodominant regions of SARS-<br/>CoV-2 for facilitating vaccine development.<br/><br/>However, our previous attempts to develop a<br/>universal vaccine that is effective for both SARS-<br/>CoV and MERS-CoV based on T-cell epitope<br/>similarity pointed out the possibility of cross-<br/>reactivity among coronaviruses (172). That can be<br/>made possible by selected potential vaccine targets<br/>that are common to both viruses. SARS-CoV-2 has<br/>been reported to be closely related to SARS-CoV<br/>(173, 174). Hence, knowledge and understanding of
