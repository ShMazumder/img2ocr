is 93.3% identical to SARS-CoV-2 across the genome.<br/>In the long lab gene, it exhibits 97.2% identity to<br/>SARS-CoV-2, which is even higher than for RaTG13<br/>(REF). In addition to RaTG13 and RmYN02, phyloge-<br/>netic analysis shows that bat coronaviruses ZC45 and<br/>ZXC21 previously detected in Rhinolophus pusillus<br/>bats from eastern China also fall into the SARS-CoV-2<br/>lineage of the subgenus Sarbecovirus” (FIG. 2). The dis-<br/>covery of diverse bat coronaviruses closely related to<br/>SARS-CoV-2 suggests that bats are possible reservoirs<br/>of SARS-CoV-2 (REF.*’). Nevertheless, on the basis of<br/>current findings, the divergence between SARS-CoV-2<br/>and related bat coronaviruses likely represents more than<br/>20 years of sequence evolution, suggesting that these bat<br/>coronaviruses can be regarded only as the likely evolu-<br/>tionary precursor of SARS-CoV-2 but not as the direct<br/>progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 (REF.*).<br/><br/>Beyond bats, pangolins are another wildlife host<br/>probably linked with SARS-CoV-2. Multiple SARS-CoV-2-<br/>related viruses have been identified in tissues of Malayan<br/>pangolins smuggled from Southeast Asia into southern<br/>China from 2017 to 2019. These viruses from pangolins<br/>independently seized by Guangxi and Guangdong pro-<br/>vincial customs belong to two distinct sublineages*-*".<br/>The Guangdong strains, which were isolated or<br/>sequenced by different research groups from smug-<br/>gled pangolins, have 99.8% sequence identity with each<br/>other"'. They are very closely related to SARS-CoV-2,<br/>exhibiting 92.4% sequence similarity. Notably, the RBD<br/>of Guangdong pangolin coronaviruses is highly similar<br/>to that of SARS-CoV-2. The receptor-binding motif<br/>(RBM; which is part of the RBD) of these viruses has<br/>only one amino acid variation from SARS-CoV-2, and<br/>it is identical to that of SARS-CoV-2 in all five critical
