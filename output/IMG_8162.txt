receptor and human proteases as entry activators; sub-<br/>sequently it fuses the viral membrane with the cell mem-<br/>brane and achieves invasion. Thus, drugs that interfere<br/>with entry may be a potential treatment for COVID-19.<br/>Umifenovir (Arbidol) is a drug approved in Russia and<br/>China for the treatment of influenza and other respira-<br/>tory viral infections. It can target the interaction between<br/>the S protein and ACE2 and inhibit membrane fusion<br/>(FIG. 5). In vitro experiments showed that it has activity<br/>against SARS-CoV-2, and current clinical data revealed<br/>it may be more effective than lopinavir and ritonavir in<br/>treating COVID-19 (REFS'>'**). However, other clinical<br/>studies showed umifenovir might not improve the prog-<br/>nosis of or accelerate SARS-CoV-2 clearance in patients<br/>with mild to moderate COVID-19 (REFS!2*!2°). Yet some<br/>ongoing clinical trials are evaluating its efficacy for<br/>COVID-19 treatment. Camostat mesylate is approved<br/>in Japan for the treatment of pancreatitis and postoper-<br/>ative reflux oesophagitis. Previous studies showed that it<br/>can prevent SARS-CoV from entering cells by blocking<br/>TMPRSS2 activity and protect mice from lethal infection<br/>with SARS-CoV in a pathogenic mouse model (wild-<br/>type mice infected with a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV<br/>strain) °'”’, Recently, a study revealed that camostat<br/>mesylate blocks the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human<br/>lung cells”. Thus, it can be a potential antiviral drug<br/>against SARS-CoV-2 infection, although so far there are<br/>not sufficient clinical data to support its efficacy.
