Center for Biotechnology Information and GISAID<br/>databases were subjected to multiple-sequence<br/>alignment and phylogenetic analyses for studying<br/>variations in the viral genome (260). All the viral<br/>strains revealed high homology of 99.99% (99.91%<br/>to 100%) at the nucleotide level and 99.99%<br/>(99.79% to 100%) at the amino acid level. Overall<br/>variation was found to be low in ORF regions, with<br/>13 variation sites recognized in la, 1b, S, 3a, M, 8,<br/>and N regions. Mutation rates of 30.53% (29/95) and<br/>29.47% (28/95) were observed at nt 28144 (ORF8)<br/>and nt 8782 (ORF 1a) positions, respectively. Owing<br/>to such selective mutations, a few specific regions of<br/>SARS-CoV-2 should not be considered for designing<br/>primers and probes. The SARS-CoV-2 reference<br/>sequence could pave the way to study molecular<br/>biology and pathobiology, along with developing<br/>diagnostics and appropriate prevention and control<br/>strategies for countering SARS-CoV-2 (260).<br/>Nucleic acids of SARS-CoV-2 can be detected<br/>from samples (64) such as bronchoalveolar lavage<br/>fluid, sputum, nasal swabs, fiber bronchoscope brush<br/>biopsy specimen, pharyngeal swabs, feces, blood,<br/>and urine, with different levels of diagnostic<br/>performance (Table 2) (80, 245, 246).
