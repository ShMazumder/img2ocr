clinical trials have been registered to evaluate the<br/>protective role of BCG vaccination against SARS-<br/>CoV-2 (363). Recently, a cohort study was conducted<br/>to evaluate the impact of childhood BCG vaccination<br/>in COVID-19 PCR _ positivity rates. However,<br/>childhood BCG vaccination was found to be<br/>associated with a rate of COVID-19-positive test<br/>results similar to that of the nonvaccinated group<br/>(364). Further studies are required to analyze<br/>whether BCG vaccination in childhood can induce<br/>protective effects against COVID-19 in adulthood.<br/>Population genetic studies conducted on 103<br/>genomes identified that the SARS-CoV-2 virus has<br/>evolved into two major types, L and S. Among the<br/>two types, L type is expected to be the most<br/>prevalent (~70%), followed by the S type (~30%)<br/>(366). This finding has a significant impact on our<br/>race to develop an ideal vaccine, since the vaccine<br/>candidate has to target both strains to be considered<br/>effective. At present, the genetic differences between<br/>the L and S types are very small and may not affect<br/>the immune response. However, we can expect<br/>further genetic variations in the coming days that<br/>could lead to the emergence of new strains (367).
