<br/>Serological surveys are also considered to be<br/>one of the most effective ones in facilitating<br/>outbreak investigation and it also helps us to<br/>derive a retrospective assessment of the<br/>disease by estimating the attack rate.°*<br/>According to the recent literature, paired serum<br/>samples can also help clinicians to diagnose<br/>COVID-19 in case of false negative results in<br/>NAAT essays.” The literature also declared that<br/>the commercial and non-commercial serological<br/>tests are under consideration in order to<br/>support the practising clinicians by assisting<br/>them in diagnosis. Similarly, there are studies<br/>published on COVID-19 which are comprised of<br/>the serological data on clinical samples.?° °°<br/><br/>6.4 Viral sequencing<br/><br/>Apart from confirming the presence of virus in<br/>the specimens, viral sequencing is also quite<br/>useful in monitoring the viral genomic<br/>mutations, which plays a very significant role in<br/>influencing the performance of the medical<br/>countermeasures inclusive of the diagnostic<br/>test. Genomic sequencing of the virus can also<br/>help further in developing several studies<br/>related to molecular epidemiology.°7
