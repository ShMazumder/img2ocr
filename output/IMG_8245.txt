Vaccine Research Center (VRC) of the National<br/>Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),<br/>part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) (182).<br/>By employing mRNA vaccine platform technology, a<br/>vaccine candidate expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike<br/>protein is likely to go through clinical testing in the<br/>coming months (180). On 16 March 2020, Jennifer<br/>Haller became the first person outside China to<br/>receive an experimental vaccine, developed by<br/>Moderna, against this pandemic virus. Moderna,<br/>along with China’s CanSino Biologics, became the<br/>first research group to launch small clinical trials of<br/>vaccines against COVID-19. Their study is<br/>evaluating the vaccine’s safety and ability to trigger<br/>immune responses (296).<br/><br/>Scientists from all over the world are trying hard<br/>to develop working vaccines with robust protective<br/>immunity against COVID-19. Vaccine candidates,<br/>like mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, INO-4800<br/>DNA coronavirus vaccine, and adenovirus type 5<br/>vector vaccine candidate (Ad5-nCoV), are a few<br/>examples under phase I clinical trials, while self-<br/>amplifying RNA vaccine, oral recombinant COVID-<br/>19 vaccine, BNT162, plant-based COVID-19<br/>vaccine, and li-Key peptide COVID-19 vaccine are
