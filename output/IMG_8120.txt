Hence,<br/>it is a relief that the current outbreak of COVID-19<br/>infection can be brought under control with the<br/>adoption of strategic preventive and _ control<br/>measures along with the early isolation of<br/>subsequent cases in the coming days. Studies also<br/>report that since air traffic between China and<br/>African countries increased many times over in the<br/>decade after the SARS outbreak, African countries<br/>need to be vigilant to prevent the spread of novel<br/>coronavirus in Africa (225). Due to fear of virus<br/>spread, Wuhan City was completely shut down<br/>(233).
