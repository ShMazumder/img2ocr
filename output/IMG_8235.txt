nucleic acid test results as one of the additional
discharge criteria in laboratory-confirmed cases of
COVID-19 (326).

The COVID-19 pandemic does not have any
novel factors, other than the genetically unique
pathogen and a further possible reservoir. The cause
and the likely future outcome are just repetitions of
our previous interactions with fatal coronaviruses.
The only difference is the time of occurrence and the
genetic distinctness of the pathogen involved.
Mutations on the RBD of CoVs facilitated their
capability of infecting newer hosts, thereby
expanding their reach to all corners of the world
(85). This is a potential threat to the health of both
animals and humans. Advanced studies using
Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction identified
the most probable origin of SARS-CoV-2 as the bat
SARS-like coronavirus, circulating in the
Rhinolophus bat family (86).

Phylogenetic analysis of 10 whole-genome
sequences of SARS-CoV-2 showed that they are
related to two CoVs of bat origin, namely, bat-SL-
CoVZC45 and _ bat-SL-CoVZXC21, which were
reported during 2018 in China (17). It was reported
that SARS-CoV-2 had been confirmed to use ACE2
as an entry receptor while exhibiting an RBD similar
