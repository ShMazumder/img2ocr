discharge criteria in laboratory-confirmed cases of<br/>COVID-19 (326).<br/><br/>The COVID-19 pandemic does not have any<br/>novel factors, other than the genetically unique<br/>pathogen and a further possible reservoir. The cause<br/>and the likely future outcome are just repetitions of<br/>our previous interactions with fatal coronaviruses.<br/>The only difference is the time of occurrence and the<br/>genetic distinctness of the pathogen involved.<br/>Mutations on the RBD of CoVs facilitated their<br/>capability of infecting newer hosts, thereby<br/>expanding their reach to all corners of the world<br/>(85). This is a potential threat to the health of both<br/>animals and humans. Advanced studies using<br/>Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction identified<br/>the most probable origin of SARS-CoV-2 as the bat<br/>SARS-like coronavirus, circulating in the<br/>Rhinolophus bat family (86).<br/><br/>Phylogenetic analysis of 10 whole-genome<br/>sequences of SARS-CoV-2 showed that they are<br/>related to two CoVs of bat origin, namely, bat-SL-<br/>CoVZC45 and _ bat-SL-CoVZXC21, which were<br/>reported during 2018 in China (17). It was reported<br/>that SARS-CoV-2 had been confirmed to use ACE2<br/>as an entry receptor while exhibiting an RBD similar
