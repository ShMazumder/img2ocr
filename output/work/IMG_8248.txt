due to the lack of diagnostic assay kits. This will further result in the extensive transmission of COVID-19, since only a portion of suspected cases can be diagnosed. In such situations, conventional serological assays, like enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), that are specific to COVID-19 IgM and IgG antibodies can be used as a high-throughput alternative (149). At present, there is no diagnostic kit available for detecting the SARS- CoV-2 antibody (150). The specific antibody profiles of COVID-19 patients were analyzed, and it was found that the IgM level lasted more than 1 month, indicating a prolonged stage of virus replication in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. The IgG levels were found to increase only in the later stages of the disease. These findings indicate that the specific antibody profiles of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV were similar (325). These findings can be utilized for the development of specific diagnostic tests against COVID-19 and can be used for rapid screening. Even though diagnostic test kits are already available that can detect the genetic sequences of SARS-CoV- 2 (95), their availability is a concern, as the number of COVID-19 cases is skyrocketing (155, 157). A major problem associated with this diagnostic kit is
