made to design and develop vaccines for CoV infection, mostly by targeting the spike glycoprotein. Nevertheless, owing to extensive diversity in antigenic variants, cross-protection rendered by the vaccines is significantly limited, even within the strains of a phylogenetic subcluster (104). Due to the lack of effective antiviral therapy and vaccines in the present scenario, we need to depend solely on implementing effective infection control measures to lessen the risk of possible nosocomial transmission (68). Recently, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 was established as the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), and the virus was found to enter the host cell mainly through endocytosis. It was also found that the major components that have a critical role in viral entry include PIKfyve, TPC2, and cathepsin L. These findings are critical, since the components described above might act as candidates for vaccines or therapeutic drugs against SARS- CoV-2 (293). The majority of the treatment options and strategies that are being evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) have been taken from our previous experiences in treating SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other emerging viral diseases. Several therapeutic
