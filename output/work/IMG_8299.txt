detected SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in cat serum samples collected in Wuhan after the COVID-19 outbreak, providing evidence for SARS-CoV-2 infection in cat populations in Wuhan, although the potential of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from cats to humans is currently uncertain®. Receptor use and pathogenesis SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor as SARS-CoV, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)''"’. Besides human ACE2 (hACE2), SARS-CoV-2 also recognizes ACE2 from pig, ferret, rhesus monkey, civet, cat, pan- golin, rabbit and dog''****”. The broad receptor usage of SARS-CoV-2 implies that it may have a wide host range, and the varied efficiency of ACE2 usage in differ- ent animals may indicate their different susceptibilities to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The $1 subunit of a corona- virus is further divided into two functional domains, an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain. Structural and biochemical analyses identified a 211 amino acid region (amino acids 319-529) at the S1 C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 as the RBD, which has a key role in virus entry and is the target of neu- tralizing antibodies”! (FIG. 5a). The RBM mediates con- tact with the ACE2 receptor (amino acids 437-507 of SARS-CoV-2 S protein), and this region in SARS-CoV-2 differs from that in SARS-CoV in the five residues crit-
