histocompatibility complex class I molecules. They potentially induce immune responses (176). The recombinant vaccine can be designed by using rabies virus (RV) as a viral vector. RV can be made to express MERS-CoV S1 protein on its surface so that an immune response is induced against MERS-CoV. The RV vector-based vaccines against MERS-CoV can induce faster antibody response as well as higher degrees of cellular immunity than the Gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM) particle vector-based vaccine. However, the latter can induce a very high antibody response at lower doses (167). Hence, the degree of humoral and cellular immune responses produced by such vaccines depends upon the vector used. Dual vaccines have been getting more popular recently. Among them, the rabies virus-based vectored vaccine platform is used to develop vaccines against emerging infectious diseases. The dual vaccine developed from inactivated rabies virus particles that express the MERS-CoV S1 domain of S protein was found to induce immune responses for both MERS-CoV and rabies virus. The vaccinated mice were found to be completely protected from challenge with MERS-CoV (169). The intranasal
