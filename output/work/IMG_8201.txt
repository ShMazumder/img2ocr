 Usually replication of coronavirus occurs within the cytoplasm and is closely associated with endoplasmic reticulum and other cellular membrane organelles. Human coronaviruses are thought to invade cells, primarily through different receptors. For 229E and OC43, amino peptidase-N (AP-N) and a sialic acid containing receptor, respectively, were known to function in this role. After the virus enters the host cell and uncoating process occurs, the genome is transcribed, and then, translated. A characteristic feature of replication is that all mRNAs form an enclosed group of typical 3’ ends; only the special portions of the 5’ ends are translated. In total, about 7 MRNAs are produced. The shortest mRNA codes and the others can express the synthesis of another genome segment for nucleoprotein. At the cell membrane, these proteins are collected and genomic RNA is initiated as a mature particle type by burgeoning from internal cell membranes.2* 2° 5 PATHOGENESIS Coronaviruses are tremendously precise and mature in most of the airway epithelial cells as observed through both in vivo and in vitro
