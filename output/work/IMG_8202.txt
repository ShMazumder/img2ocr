disease outbreaks that have not been controlled to date, although extensive efforts are being put in place to counter this virus (25). This virus has been proposed to be designated/named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), which determined the virus belongs to the Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus category and found this virus is related to SARS-CoVs (26). SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the order WNidovirales, family Coronaviridae, subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, which is subdivided into four genera, viz., | Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus (3, 27). The genera Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus originate from bats, while =Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus have evolved from bird and swine gene pools (24, 28, 29, 275). Coronaviruses possess an unsegmented, single- stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of around 30 kb, enclosed by a 5'-cap and 3’-poly(A) tail (30). The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is 29,891 bp long, with a G+C content of 38% (31). These viruses are encircled with an envelope containing — viral
