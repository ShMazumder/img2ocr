management of COVID-19 would be difficult for low-income countries due to their inability to respond rapidly due to the lack of an efficient health care system (65). Controlling the imported cases is critical in preventing the spread of COVID-19 to other countries that have not reported the disease until now. The possibility of an imported case of COVID-19 leading to sustained human-to-human transmission was estimated to be 0.41. This can be reduced to a value of 0.012 by decreasing the mean time from the onset of symptoms to hospitalization and can only be made possible by using intense disease surveillance systems (235). The silent importations of infected individuals (before the manifestation of clinical signs) also contributed significantly to the spread of disease across the major cities of the world. Even though the travel ban was implemented in Wuhan (89), infected persons who traveled out of the city just before the imposition of the ban might have remained undetected and resulted in local outbreaks (236). Emerging novel diseases like COVID-19 are difficult to contain within the country of origin, since globalization has led to a world without borders. Hence, international collaboration plays a vital role
