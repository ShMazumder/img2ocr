on its official website, has mentioned a detailed list of COVID-19 vaccine agents that are under consideration. Different phases of trials are ongoing for live attenuated virus vaccines, formaldehyde alum inactivated vaccine, adenovirus type 5 vector vaccine, LNP-encapsulated mRNA vaccine, DNA plasmid vaccine, and S protein, S-trimer, and li-Key peptide as a subunit protein vaccine, among others (298). The process of vaccine development usually takes approximately ten years, in the case of inactivated or live attenuated vaccines, since it involves the generation of long-term efficacy data. However, this was brought down to 5 years during the Ebola emergency for viral vector vaccines. In the urgency associated with the COVID-19 outbreaks, we expect a vaccine by the end of this year (343). The development of an effective vaccine against COVID-19 with high speed and precision is the combined result of advancements in computational biology, gene synthesis, protein engineering, and the invention of advanced manufacturing platforms (342). The recurring nature of the coronavirus outbreaks calls for the development of a pan-coronavirus vaccine that can produce cross-reactive antibodies.
