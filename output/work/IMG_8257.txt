further adding to the complexity of disease transmission dynamics. Atypical clinical manifestations may only express symptoms such as fatigue instead of respiratory signs such as fever, cough, and sputum. In such cases, the clinician must be vigilant for the possible occurrence of asymptomatic and atypical clinical manifestations to avoid the possibility of missed diagnoses. The present outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 was, indeed, expected. Similar to previous outbreaks, the current pandemic also will be contained shortly. However, the real question is, how are we planning to counter the next zoonotic CoV epidemic that is likely to occur within the next 5 to 10 years or perhaps sooner? Our knowledge of most of the bat CoVs is scarce, as these viruses have not been isolated and studied, and extensive studies on such viruses are typically only conducted when they are associated with specific disease outbreaks. The next step following the control of the COVID-19 outbreak in China should be focused on_ screening, identification, isolation, and characterization of CoVs_ present in wildlife species of China, particularly in bats. Both in vitro and in vivo studies (using suitable animal models) should be conducted
