the WHO and CDC websites.°’ 16 CONCLUSION The corona virus (COVID-19) spreads at an alarming rate all over the world. The outbreak of the virus has confronted the world's economic, medical and public health infrastructure. Elderly and immunocompromised patients also are susceptible to the virus's mortal impacts. Currently, there is no documented cure for the virus and no vaccine has been created, although some treatment protocols have been promising. Therefore, the virus can be controlled with the appropriate prevention strategies. Also, attempts have to be made to formulate systematic strategies to prevent such future zoonotic outbreaks.
