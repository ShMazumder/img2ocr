specific quantitative RT-PCR in throat swab and<br/>sputum samples collected from COVID-19-infected<br/>individuals. The results indicated that the viral load<br/>peaked at around 5 to 6 days following the onset of<br/>symptoms, and it ranged from 10* to 107 copies/ml<br/>during this time (151). In another study, the viral<br/>load was found to be higher in the nasal swabs than<br/>the throat swabs obtained from COVID-19<br/>symptomatic patients (82). Although initially it was<br/>thought that viral load would be associated with poor<br/>outcomes, some case reports have shown<br/>asymptomatic individuals with high viral loads<br/>(247). Recently, the viral load in nasal and throat<br/>swabs of 17 symptomatic patients was determined,<br/>and higher viral loads were recorded soon after the<br/>onset of symptoms, particularly in the nose<br/>compared to the throat. The pattern of viral nucleic<br/>acid shedding of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients was<br/>similar to that of influenza patients but seemed to be<br/>different from that of SARS-CoV patients. The viral<br/>load detected in asymptomatic patients resembled<br/>that of symptomatic patients as studied in China,<br/>which reflects the transmission perspective of<br/>asymptomatic or symptomatic patients having<br/>minimum signs and symptoms (82).
