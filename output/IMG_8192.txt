administering the approved dose (340). However,<br/>ivermectin, being a host-directed agent, exhibits<br/>antiviral activity by targeting a critical cellular<br/>process of the mammalian cell. Therefore, the<br/>administration of ivermectin, even at lower doses,<br/>will reduce the viral load at a minor level. This slight<br/>decrease will provide a great advantage to the<br/>immune system for mounting a large-scale antiviral<br/>response against SARS-CoV-2 (341). Further, a<br/>combination of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine<br/>might have a synergistic effect, since ivermectin<br/>reduces viral replication, while hydroxychloroquine<br/>inhibits the entry of the virus in the host cell (339).<br/>Further, in vivo studies and randomized clinical<br/>control trials are required to understand the<br/>mechanism as well as the clinical utility of this<br/>promising drug.<br/><br/>Nafamostat is a potent inhibitor of MERS-CoV<br/>that acts by preventing membrane fusion.<br/>Nevertheless, it does not have any sort of inhibitory<br/>action against SARS-CoV-2 infection (194).<br/>Recently, several newly synthesized halogenated<br/>triazole compounds wereâ€™ evaluated, using<br/>fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-<br/>based helicase assays, for their ability to inhibit
