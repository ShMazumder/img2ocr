administering the approved dose (340). However, ivermectin, being a host-directed agent, exhibits antiviral activity by targeting a critical cellular process of the mammalian cell. Therefore, the administration of ivermectin, even at lower doses, will reduce the viral load at a minor level. This slight decrease will provide a great advantage to the immune system for mounting a large-scale antiviral response against SARS-CoV-2 (341). Further, a combination of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine might have a synergistic effect, since ivermectin reduces viral replication, while hydroxychloroquine inhibits the entry of the virus in the host cell (339). Further, in vivo studies and randomized clinical control trials are required to understand the mechanism as well as the clinical utility of this promising drug.<br/>Nafamostat is a potent inhibitor of MERS-CoV that acts by preventing membrane fusion. Nevertheless, it does not have any sort of inhibitory action against SARS-CoV-2 infection (194). Recently, several newly synthesized halogenated triazole compounds wereâ€™ evaluated, using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)- based helicase assays, for their ability to inhibit
