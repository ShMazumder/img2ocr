logical process caused by a cytokine storm®**”. In this<br/>cohort of patient, around 2.3% people died within<br/>a median time of 16 days from disease onset***. Men<br/>older than 68 years had a higher risk of respiratory fail-<br/>ure, acute cardiac injury and heart failure that led to<br/>death, regardless of a history of cardiovascular disease*°<br/>(FIG. 4). Most patients recovered enough to be released<br/>from hospital in 2 weeks” (FIG. 4).<br/><br/>Early transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan in<br/>December 2019 was initially linked to the Huanan<br/>Seafood Wholesale Market, and it was suggested as<br/>the source of the outbreak’”’. However, community<br/>transmission might have happened before that**. Later,<br/>ongoing human-to-human transmission propagated the<br/>outbreak’. It is generally accepted that SARS-CoV-2 is<br/>more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV;<br/>however, determination of an accurate reproduction<br/>number (RO) for COVID-19 is not possible yet, as many<br/>asymptomatic infections cannot be accurately accounted<br/>for at this stage®. An estimated RO of 2.5 (ranging from<br/>1.8 to 3.6) has been proposed for SARS-CoV-2 recently,<br/>compared with 2.0-3.0 for SARS-CoV”. Notably, most<br/>of the SARS-CoV-2 human-to-human transmission<br/>early in China occurred in family clusters, and in other<br/>countries large outbreaks also happened in other set-<br/>tings, such as migrant worker communities, slaughter-<br/>houses and meat packing plants, indicating the necessity<br/>of isolating infected people”'*’!-°’. Nosocomial transmis-<br/>sion was not the main source of transmission in China<br/>because of the implementation of infection control<br/>measures in clinical settings’. By contrast, a high risk<br/>of nosocomial transmission was reported in some other
