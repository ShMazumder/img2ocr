different kinds of clinical manifestations, varying<br/>from enteritis in cows and pigs, upper respiratory<br/>disease in chickens, and fatal respiratory infections<br/>in humans (30).<br/><br/>Among the CoV genera, Alphacoronavirus and<br/>Betacoronavirus infect mammals, while<br/>Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus mainly<br/>infect birds, fishes, and, sometimes, mammals (27,<br/>29, 106). Several novel coronaviruses that come<br/>under the genus Deltacoronavirus have been<br/>discovered in the past from birds, like Wigeon<br/>coronavirus HKU20, Bulbul coronavirus HKU11,<br/>Munia coronavirus HKU13, white-eye coronavirus<br/>HKU16, night-heron coronavirus HKU19, and<br/>common moorhen coronavirus HKU21, as well as<br/>from pigs (porcine coronavirus HKU15) (6, 29).<br/>Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine<br/>epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and _ porcine<br/>hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV)<br/>are some of the coronaviruses of swine. Among<br/>them, TGEV and PEDV are responsible for causing<br/>severe gastroenteritis in young piglets with<br/>noteworthy morbidity and mortality. Infection with<br/>PHEV also causes enteric infection but can cause<br/>encephalitis due to its ability to infect the nervous
