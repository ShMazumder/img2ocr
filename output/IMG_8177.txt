to be confirmed if the respiratory tract aspirate or
blood samples test positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic
acid using RT-PCR or by the identification of SARS-
CoV-2 genetic sequence in respiratory tract aspirate
or blood samples (80). The patient will be confirmed
as cured when two subsequent oral swab results are
negative (153). Recently, the live virus was detected
in the self-collected saliva of patients infected with
COVID-19. These findings were confirmative of
using saliva as a noninvasive specimen for the
diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in suspected
individuals (152). It has also been observed that the
initial screening of COVID-19 patients infected with
RT-PCR may give negative results even if they have
chest CT findings that are suggestive of infection.
Hence, for the accurate diagnosis of COVID-19, a
combination of repeated swab tests using RT-PCR
and CT scanning is required to prevent the
possibility of false-negative results during disease
screening (154). RT-PCR is the most widely used test
for diagnosing COVID-19. However, it has some
significant limitations from the clinical perspective,
since it will not give any clarity regarding disease
progression. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) can be
used for the quantification of viral load in the

samples obtained from lower respiratory tracts.
