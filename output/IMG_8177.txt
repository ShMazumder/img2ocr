blood samples test positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic<br/>acid using RT-PCR or by the identification of SARS-<br/>CoV-2 genetic sequence in respiratory tract aspirate<br/>or blood samples (80). The patient will be confirmed<br/>as cured when two subsequent oral swab results are<br/>negative (153). Recently, the live virus was detected<br/>in the self-collected saliva of patients infected with<br/>COVID-19. These findings were confirmative of<br/>using saliva as a noninvasive specimen for the<br/>diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in suspected<br/>individuals (152). It has also been observed that the<br/>initial screening of COVID-19 patients infected with<br/>RT-PCR may give negative results even if they have<br/>chest CT findings that are suggestive of infection.<br/>Hence, for the accurate diagnosis of COVID-19, a<br/>combination of repeated swab tests using RT-PCR<br/>and CT scanning is required to prevent the<br/>possibility of false-negative results during disease<br/>screening (154). RT-PCR is the most widely used test<br/>for diagnosing COVID-19. However, it has some<br/>significant limitations from the clinical perspective,<br/>since it will not give any clarity regarding disease<br/>progression. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) can be<br/>used for the quantification of viral load in the<br/><br/>samples obtained from lower respiratory tracts.
