Preliminary results of the<br/>Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT) clinical<br/>rial by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious<br/>Diseases (NIAID) reported that remdesivir can shorten<br/>the recovery time in hospitalized adults with COVID-19<br/>by a couple days compared with placebo, but the differ-<br/>ence in mortality was not statistically significant'**. The<br/>FDA has issued an emergency use authorization for rem-<br/>desivir for the treatment of hospitalized patients with<br/>severe COVID-19. It is also the first approved option by<br/>he European Union for treatment of adults and adoles-<br/>cents with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen.<br/>Several international phase III clinical trials are contin-<br/>uing to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir for<br/>he treatment of COVID-19.<br/><br/>Favilavir (T-705), which is an antiviral drug devel-<br/>oped in Japan to treat influenza, has been approved in<br/>China, Russia and India for the treatment of COVID-19.<br/>A clinical study in China showed that favilavir signif-<br/>icantly reduced the signs of improved disease signs<br/>on chest imaging and shortened the time to viral<br/>clearance’. A preliminary report in Japan showed rates<br/>of clinical improvement of 73.8% and 87.8% from the<br/>start of favilavir therapy in patients with mild COVID-19<br/>at 7 and 14 days, respectively, and 40.1% and 60.3%<br/>in patients with severe COVID-19 at 7 and 14 days,
