reported more than 20 million cases of COVID-19, and<br/>more than 733,000 patients had died’'. High mortality<br/>occurred especially when health-care resources were<br/>overwhelmed. The USA is the country with the larges<br/>number of cases so far.<br/><br/>Although genetic evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2<br/>is a natural virus that likely originated in animals, there is<br/>no conclusion yet about when and where the virus firs!<br/>entered humans. As some of the first reported cases<br/>in Wuhan had no epidemiological link to the seafood<br/>market”, it has been suggested that the market may not be<br/>the initial source of human infection with SARS-CoV-2.<br/>One study from France detected SARS-CoV-2 by PCR<br/>in a stored sample from a patient who had pneumonia<br/>at the end of 2019, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 might have<br/>spread there much earlier than the generally known<br/>starting time of the outbreak in France”*. However, this<br/>individual early report cannot give a solid answer to the<br/>origin of SARS-CoV-2 and contamination, and thus a<br/>false positive result cannot be excluded. To address this<br/>highly controversial issue, further retrospective inves-<br/>tigations involving a larger number of banked samples<br/>from patients, animals and environments need to be<br/>conducted worldwide with well-validated assays.<br/><br/>Genomics, phylogeny and taxonomy<br/><br/>As a novel betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 shares<br/>79% genome sequence identity with SARS-CoV and<br/>50% with MERS-CoV™. Its genome organization is<br/>shared with other betacoronaviruses. The six functional<br/>open reading frames (ORFs) are arranged in order from<br/>5’ to 3’: replicase (ORFla/ORF 1b), spike (S), envelope<br/>(E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). In addition,<br/>seven putative ORFs encoding accessory proteins are<br/>interspersed between the structural genes”. Most of<br/>the proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 have a similar
