ranging from the common cold to severe and<br/>ultimately fatal illnesses, such as SARS, MERS, and,<br/>presently, COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 is considered<br/>one of the seven members of the CoV family that<br/>infect humans (3), and it belongs to the same lineage<br/>of CoVs that causes SARS; however, this novel virus<br/>is genetically distinct. Until 2020, six CoVs were<br/>known to infect humans, including human CoV 229E<br/>(HCoV-229E), HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-<br/>HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV. Although<br/>SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have resulted in<br/>outbreaks with high mortality, others remain<br/>associated with mild upper-respiratory-tract illnesses<br/>(4).<br/><br/>Newly evolved CoVs pose a high threat to global<br/>public health. The current emergence of COVID-19<br/>is the third CoV outbreak in humans over the past 2<br/>decades (5). It is no coincidence that Fan et al.<br/>predicted potential SARS- or MERS-like CoV<br/>outbreaks in China following pathogen transmission<br/>from bats (6). COVID-19 emerged in China and<br/>spread rapidly throughout the country and,<br/>subsequently, to other countries. Due to the severity<br/>of this outbreak and the potential of spreading on an<br/>international scale, the WHO declared a global<br/><br/>health emeroency an 21 Janinary N00: anheeninently
