Although in vitro research carried out with these<br/>therapeutics showed efficacy, most need appropriate<br/>support from randomized animal or human trials.<br/>Therefore, they might be of limited applicability and<br/>require trials against SARS-CoV-2 to gain practical<br/>usefulness. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2<br/>leads to the exacerbation of pneumonia as a<br/>consequence of the imbalance in the renin-<br/>angiotensin system (RAS). The virus-induced<br/>pulmonary inflammatory responses may be reduced<br/>by the administration of ACE inhibitors (ACEI) and<br/>angiotensin type-1 receptor (AT1R) (207).<br/><br/>Several investigations have suggested the use of<br/>small-molecule inhibitors for the potential control of<br/>SARS-CoV infections. Drugs of the FDA-approved<br/>compound library were screened to identify four<br/>small-molecule inhibitors of | MERS-CoV<br/>(chlorpromazine, chloroquine, loperamide, and<br/>lopinavir) that inhibited viral replication. These<br/>compounds also hinder SARS-CoV and human<br/>CoVs (208). Therapeutic strategies involving the use<br/>of specific antibodies or compounds that neutralize<br/>cytokines and their receptors will help to restrain the<br/>host inflammatory responses. Such drugs acting<br/>specifically in the respiratory tract will help to
