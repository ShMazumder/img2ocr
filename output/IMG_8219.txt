resulting in severe interstitial inflammation of the<br/>lungs. This is evident on computed tomography (CT)<br/>images as ground-glass opacity in the lungs. This<br/>lesion initially involves a single lobe but later<br/>expands to multiple lung lobes (118). The<br/>histological assessment of lung biopsy samples<br/>obtained from COVID-19-infected patients revealed<br/>diffuse alveolar damage, cellular fibromyxoid<br/>exudates, hyaline membrane formation, and<br/>desquamation of pneumocytes, indicative of acute<br/>respiratory distress syndrome (119). It was also<br/>found that the SARS-CoV-2-infected patients often<br/>have lymphocytopenia with or without leukocyte<br/>abnormalities. The degree of lymphocytopenia gives<br/>an idea about disease prognosis, as it is found to be<br/>positively correlated with disease severity (118).<br/>Pregnant women are considered to have a higher risk<br/>of getting infected by COVID-19. The coronaviruses<br/>can cause adverse outcomes for the fetus, such as<br/>intrauterine growth restriction, spontaneous abortion,<br/>preterm delivery, and perinatal death.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the possibility of intrauterine<br/>maternal-fetal transmission (vertical transmission) of<br/>CoVs is low and was not seen during either the<br/>SARS- or MERS-CoV outbreak (120). However,
