proteins of COVID-19 have revealed 27 amino acid<br/>substitutions within a 1,273-amino-acid stretch (16).<br/>Six substitutions are located in the RBD (amino<br/>acids 357 to 528), while four substitutions are in the<br/>RBM at the CTD of the S1 domain (16). Of note, no<br/>amino acid change is seen in the RBM, which binds<br/>directly to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2<br/>(ACE2) receptor in SARS-CoV (16, 46). At present,<br/>the main emphasis is knowing how many differences<br/>would be required to change the host tropism.<br/>Sequence comparison revealed 17 nonsynonymous<br/>changes between the early sequence of SARS-CoV-2<br/>and the later isolates of SARS-CoV. The changes<br/>were found scattered over the genome of the virus,<br/>with nine substitutions in ORFlab, ORF8 (4<br/>substitutions), the spike gene (3 substitutions), and<br/>ORF7a (single substitution) (4). Notably, the same<br/>nonsynonymous changes were found in a familial<br/>cluster, indicating that the viral evolution happened<br/>during person-to-person transmission (4, 47). Such<br/>adaptive evolution events are frequent and constitute<br/>a constantly ongoing process once the virus spreads<br/>among new hosts (47). Even though no functional<br/>changes occur in the virus associated with this<br/>adaptive evolution, close monitoring of the viral
