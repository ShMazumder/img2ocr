stalk (45). Recently, structural analyses of the S
proteins of COVID-19 have revealed 27 amino acid
substitutions within a 1,273-amino-acid stretch (16).
Six substitutions are located in the RBD (amino
acids 357 to 528), while four substitutions are in the
RBM at the CTD of the S1 domain (16). Of note, no
amino acid change is seen in the RBM, which binds
directly to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2
(ACE2) receptor in SARS-CoV (16, 46). At present,
the main emphasis is knowing how many differences
would be required to change the host tropism.
Sequence comparison revealed 17 nonsynonymous
changes between the early sequence of SARS-CoV-2
and the later isolates of SARS-CoV. The changes
were found scattered over the genome of the virus,
with nine substitutions in ORFlab, ORF8 (4
substitutions), the spike gene (3 substitutions), and
ORF7a (single substitution) (4). Notably, the same
nonsynonymous changes were found in a familial
cluster, indicating that the viral evolution happened
during person-to-person transmission (4, 47). Such
adaptive evolution events are frequent and constitute
a constantly ongoing process once the virus spreads
among new hosts (47). Even though no functional
changes occur in the virus associated with this
adaptive evolution, close monitoring of the viral
