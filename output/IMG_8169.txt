and COVID-19<br/><br/>Coronavirus infection in humans is commonly<br/>associated with mild to severe respiratory diseases,<br/>with high fever, severe inflammation, cough, and<br/>internal organ dysfunction that can even lead to<br/>death (92). Most of the identified coronaviruses<br/>cause the common cold in humans. However, this<br/>changed when SARS-CoV was identified, paving the<br/>way for severe forms of the disease in humans (22).<br/>Our previous experience with the outbreaks of other<br/>coronaviruses, like SARS and MERS, suggests that<br/>the mode of transmission in COVID-19 as mainly<br/>human-to-human transmission via direct contact,<br/>droplets, and fomites (25). Recent studies have<br/>demonstrated that the virus could remain viable for<br/>hours in aerosols and up to days on surfaces; thus,<br/>aerosol and fomite contamination could play potent<br/>roles in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (257).<br/><br/>The immune response against coronavirus is vital<br/>to control and get rid of the infection. However,<br/>maladjusted immune responses may contribute to the<br/>immunopathology of the disease, resulting in<br/>impairment of pulmonary gas _ exchange.<br/>Understanding the interaction between CoVs and<br/>host innate immune systems could enlighten our
