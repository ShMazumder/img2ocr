<br/>In the unrooted phylogenetic tree of different<br/>betacoronaviruses based on the S protein, virus<br/>sequences from different subgenera grouped into<br/>separate clusters. SARS-CoV-2 sequences from<br/>Wuhan and other countries exhibited a close<br/>relationship and appeared in a single cluster (Fig. 1).<br/>The CoVs from the subgenus Sarbecovirus appeared<br/>jointly in SplitsTree and divided into three<br/>subclusters, namely, SARS-CoV-2, bat-SARS-like-<br/>CoV (bat-SL-CoV), and SARS-CoV (Fig. 1). In the<br/>case of other subgenera, like Merbecovirus, all of the<br/>sequences grouped in a single cluster, whereas in<br/>Embecovirus, different species, comprised of canine<br/>respiratory CoVs, bovine CoVs, equine CoVs, and<br/>human CoV strain (OC43), grouped in a common<br/>cluster. Isolates in the subgenera Nobecovorus and<br/>Hibecovirus were found to be placed separately<br/>away from other reported SARS-CoVs but shared a<br/>bat origin.<br/><br/>CURRENT WORLDWIDE SCENARIO OF<br/>SARS-CoV-2<br/><br/>This novel virus, SARS-CoV-2, comes under the<br/>subgenus Sarbecovirus of the Orthocoronavirinae<br/>subfamily and is entirely different from the viruses
