morphology and tropism (54). The E protein consists<br/>of three domains, namely, a short hydrophilic amino<br/>terminal, a large hydrophobic transmembrane<br/>domain, and an efficient C-terminal domain (51).<br/>The SARS-CoV-2 E protein reveals a similar amino<br/>acid constitution without any substitution (16).<br/><br/>N Protein<br/><br/>The N protein of coronavirus is multipurpose.<br/>Among several functions, it plays a role in complex<br/>formation with the viral genome, facilitates M<br/>protein interaction needed during virion assembly,<br/>and enhances the transcription efficiency of the virus<br/>(55, 56). It contains three highly conserved and<br/>distinct domains, namely, an NTD, an RNA-binding<br/>domain or a linker region (LKR), and a CTD (57).<br/>The NTD binds with the 3â€™ end of the viral genome,<br/>perhaps via electrostatic interactions, and is highly<br/>diverged both in length and sequence (58). The<br/>charged LKR is serine and arginine rich and is also<br/>known as the SR (serine and arginine) domain (59).<br/>The LKR is capable of direct interaction with in vitro<br/>RNA interaction and is responsible for cell signaling<br/>(60, 61). It also modulates the antiviral response of<br/>the host by working as an antagonist for interferon
