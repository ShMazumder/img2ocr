health emergency on 31 January 2020; subsequently,
on 11 March 2020, they declared it a pandemic
situation. At present, we are not in a position to
effectively treat COVID-19, since neither approved
vaccines nor specific antiviral drugs for treating
human CoV infections are available (7-9). Most
nations are currently making efforts to prevent the
further spreading of this potentially deadly virus by
implementing preventive and control strategies.

In domestic animals, infections with CoVs are
associated with a broad spectrum of pathological
conditions. Apart from infectious bronchitis virus,
canine respiratory CoV, and mouse hepatitis virus,
CoVs are predominantly associated with
gastrointestinal diseases (10). The emergence of
novel CoVs may have become possible because of
multiple CoVs being maintained in their natural host,
which could have favored the probability of genetic
recombination (10). High genetic diversity and the
ability to infect multiple host species are a result of
high-frequency mutations in CoVs, which occur due
to the instability of RNA-dependent RNA
polymerases along with higher rates of homologous
RNA recombination (10, 11). Identifying the origin
of SARS-CoV-2 and the pathogenâ€™s evolution will be
helpful for disease surveillance (12), development of
