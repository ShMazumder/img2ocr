on 11 March 2020, they declared it a pandemic<br/>situation. At present, we are not in a position to<br/>effectively treat COVID-19, since neither approved<br/>vaccines nor specific antiviral drugs for treating<br/>human CoV infections are available (7-9). Most<br/>nations are currently making efforts to prevent the<br/>further spreading of this potentially deadly virus by<br/>implementing preventive and control strategies.<br/><br/>In domestic animals, infections with CoVs are<br/>associated with a broad spectrum of pathological<br/>conditions. Apart from infectious bronchitis virus,<br/>canine respiratory CoV, and mouse hepatitis virus,<br/>CoVs are predominantly associated with<br/>gastrointestinal diseases (10). The emergence of<br/>novel CoVs may have become possible because of<br/>multiple CoVs being maintained in their natural host,<br/>which could have favored the probability of genetic<br/>recombination (10). High genetic diversity and the<br/>ability to infect multiple host species are a result of<br/>high-frequency mutations in CoVs, which occur due<br/>to the instability of RNA-dependent RNA<br/>polymerases along with higher rates of homologous<br/>RNA recombination (10, 11). Identifying the origin<br/>of SARS-CoV-2 and the pathogenâ€™s evolution will be<br/>helpful for disease surveillance (12), development of
