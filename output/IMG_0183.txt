so-called species barrier (287).<br/><br/>The host spectrum of coronavirus increased when<br/>a novel coronavirus, namely, SW1, was recognized<br/>in the liver tissue of a captive beluga whale<br/>(Delphinapterus leucas) (138). In recent decades,<br/>several novel coronaviruses were identified from<br/>different animal species. Bats can harbor these<br/>viruses without manifesting any clinical disease but<br/>are persistently infected (30). They are the only<br/>mammals with the capacity for self-powered flight,<br/>which enables them to migrate long distances, unlike<br/>land mammals. Bats are distributed worldwide and<br/>also account for about a fifth of all mammalian<br/>species (6). This makes them the ideal reservoir host<br/>for many viral agents and also the source of novel<br/>coronaviruses that have yet to be identified. It has<br/>become a necessity to study the diversity of<br/>coronavirus in the bat population to prevent future<br/>outbreaks that could jeopardize livestock and public<br/>health. The repeated outbreaks caused by bat-origin<br/>coronaviruses calls for the development of efficient<br/>molecular surveillance strategies for studying<br/>Betacoronavirus among animals (12), especially in<br/>the Rhinolophus bat family (86). Chinese bats have<br/>high commercial value, since they are used in
