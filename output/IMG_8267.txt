clinical trials will not be available. The newly developed drugs cannot be marketed due to the lack of end users.<br/>Vaccines<br/>The S protein plays a significant role in the induction of protective immunity against SARS-CoV by mediating T-cell responses and neutralizing antibody production (168). In the past few decades, we have seen several attempts to develop a vaccine against human coronaviruses by using S protein as the target (168, 169). However, the developed vaccines have minimal application, even among closely related strains of the virus, due to a lack of cross-protection. That is mainly because of the extensive diversity existing among the different antigenic variants of the virus (104). The contributions of the structural proteins, like spike (S), matrix (M), small envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, of SARS-CoV to induce protective immunity has been evaluated by expressing them in a recombinant parainfluenza virus type 3 vector (BHPIV3). Of note, the result was conclusive that the expression of M, E, or N proteins without the presence of S protein would not
