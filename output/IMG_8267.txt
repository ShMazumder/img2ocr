In the past few decades,<br/>we have seen several attempts to develop a vaccine<br/>against human coronaviruses by using S protein as<br/>the target (168, 169). However, the developed<br/>vaccines have minimal application, even among<br/>closely related strains of the virus, due to a lack of<br/>cross-protection. That is mainly because of the<br/>extensive diversity existing among the different<br/>antigenic variants of the virus (104). The<br/>contributions of the structural proteins, like spike<br/>(S), matrix (M), small envelope (E), and<br/>nucleocapsid (N) proteins, of SARS-CoV to induce<br/>protective immunity has been evaluated by<br/>expressing them in a recombinant parainfluenza<br/>virus type 3 vector (BHPIV3). Of note, the result<br/>was conclusive that the expression of M, E, or N<br/>proteins without the presence of S protein would not
