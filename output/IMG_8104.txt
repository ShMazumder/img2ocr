coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-<br/>19) in suspected human cases<br/><br/>The assessment of the patients with COVID-19<br/>should be based on the clinical features and<br/>also epidemiological factors. The screening<br/>protocols must be prepared and followed per<br/>the native context.*' Collecting and testing of<br/>specimen samples from the suspected<br/>individual is considered to be one of the main<br/>principles for controlling and managing the<br/>outbreak of the disease in a country. The<br/>suspected cases must be screened thoroughly<br/>in order to detect the virus with the help of<br/>nucleic acid amplification tests such as reverse<br/>transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-<br/>PCR). If a country or a particular region does not<br/>have the facility to test the specimens, the<br/>specimens of the suspected individual should<br/>be sent to the nearest reference laboratories<br/>per the list provided by WHO.Â°7<br/><br/>It is also recommended that the suspected<br/>patients be tested for the other respiratory<br/>pathogens by performing the routine laboratory<br/>investigation per the local guidelines, mainly to<br/>differentiate from other viruses that include<br/>influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus,<br/>respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human
