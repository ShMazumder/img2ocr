cardiovascular adverse effects. Hence, as a<br/>cautionary approach, it is better to recommend the<br/>use of NSAIDs as the first-line option for managing<br/>COVID-19 symptoms (302). The use _ of<br/>corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients is still a matter<br/>of controversy and requires further systematic<br/>clinical studies. The guidelines that were put forward<br/>to manage critically ill adults suggest the use of<br/>systemic corticosteroids in mechanically ventilated<br/>adults with ARDS (303). The generalized use of<br/>corticosteroids is not indicated in COVID-19, since<br/>there are some concerns associated with the use of<br/>corticosteroids in viral pneumonia. Stem cell therapy<br/>using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is another<br/>hopeful strategy that can be used in clinical cases of<br/>COVID-19 owing to its potential<br/>immunomodulatory capacity. It may have a<br/>beneficial role in attenuating the cytokine storm that<br/>is observed in severe cases of SARS-CoV-2<br/>infection, thereby reducing mortality. Among the<br/>different types of MSCs, expanded umbilical cord<br/>MSCs can be considered a potential therapeutic<br/>agent that requires further validation for managing<br/>critically ill COVID-19 patients (304).<br/><br/>Repurposed broad-spectrum antiviral drugs
