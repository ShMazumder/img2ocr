uses with the occurrence of respiratory and
cardiovascular adverse effects. Hence, as a
cautionary approach, it is better to recommend the
use of NSAIDs as the first-line option for managing
COVID-19 symptoms (302). The use _ of
corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients is still a matter
of controversy and requires further systematic
clinical studies. The guidelines that were put forward
to manage critically ill adults suggest the use of
systemic corticosteroids in mechanically ventilated
adults with ARDS (303). The generalized use of
corticosteroids is not indicated in COVID-19, since
there are some concerns associated with the use of
corticosteroids in viral pneumonia. Stem cell therapy
using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is another
hopeful strategy that can be used in clinical cases of
COVID-19 owing to its potential
immunomodulatory capacity. It may have a
beneficial role in attenuating the cytokine storm that
is observed in severe cases of SARS-CoV-2
infection, thereby reducing mortality. Among the
different types of MSCs, expanded umbilical cord
MSCs can be considered a potential therapeutic
agent that requires further validation for managing
critically ill COVID-19 patients (304).
