biopsy specimens, pharyngeal swabs, feces, and<br/>blood (246).<br/><br/>The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in fecal samples<br/>has posed grave public health concerns. In addition<br/>to the direct transmission mainly occurring via<br/>droplets of sneezing and coughing, other routes, such<br/>as fecal excretion and environmental and fomite<br/>contamination, are contributing to SARS-CoV-2<br/>transmission and spread (249-252). Fecal excretion<br/>has also been documented for SARS-CoV and<br/>MERS-CoV, along with the potential to stay viable<br/>in situations aiding fecal-oral transmission. Thus,<br/>SARS-CoV-2 has every possibility to be transmitted<br/>through this mode. Fecal-oral transmission of SARS-<br/>CoV-2, particularly in regions having low standards<br/>of hygiene and poor sanitation, may have grave<br/>consequences with regard to the high spread of this<br/>virus. Ethanol and disinfectants containing chlorine<br/>or bleach are effective against coronaviruses<br/>(249-252). Appropriate precautions need to be<br/>followed strictly while handling the stools of patients<br/>infected with SARS-CoV-2. Biowaste materials and<br/>sewage from hospitals must be adequately<br/>disinfected, treated, and disposed of properly. The<br/>significance of frequent and good hand hygiene and
