<br/>a<br/><br/>been used based on the experience<br/>with SARS and MERS. In a historical<br/>control study in patients with SARS,<br/>patients treated with lopinavir-<br/>ritonavir with ribavirin had better<br/>outcomes as compared to those given<br/><br/>ribavirin alone [15].<br/><br/>In the case series of 99 hospitalized<br/>patients with COVID-19 infection from<br/>Wuhan, oxygen was given to 76%, non-<br/>invasive ventilation in 13%,<br/>mechanical ventilation in 4%,<br/>extracorporeal membrane oxygenation<br/>(ECMO) in 3%, continuous renal<br/>replacement therapy (CRRT) in 9%,<br/>antibiotics in 71%, antifungals in 15%,<br/>glucocorticoids in 19% and intravenous<br/>immunoglobulin therapy in 27% [15].<br/>Antiviral therapy consisting of<br/>oseltamivir, ganciclovir and lopinavir-<br/>ritonavir was given to 75% of the<br/>patients. The duration of non-invasive<br/><br/>ventilation was 4-22 d [median 9 d]
