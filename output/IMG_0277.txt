distress, shock or hypoxaemia. Patients with<br/>SARI can be given conservative fluid therapy<br/>only when there is no evidence of shock.<br/>Empiric antimicrobial therapy must be started<br/>to manage SARI. For patients with sepsis,<br/>antimicrobials must be administered within 1<br/>hour of initial assessments. The WHO and CDC<br/>recommend that glucocorticoids not be used in<br/>patients with COVID-19 pneumonia except<br/>where there are other indications (exacerbation<br/>of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).°?<br/><br/>Patients’ clinical deterioration is closely<br/>observed with SARI; however, rapidly<br/>progressive respiratory failure and sepsis<br/>require immediate supportive care<br/>interventions comprising quick use of<br/>neuromuscular blockade and sedatives,<br/>hemodynamic management, nutritional<br/>support, maintenance of blood glucose levels,<br/>prompt assessment and treatment of<br/>nosocomial pneumonia, and prophylaxis<br/>against deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and<br/>gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding.©° Generally, such<br/>patients give way to their primary illness to<br/>secondary complications like sepsis or<br/>multiorgan system failure.*°
