crucial role in enhancing protective humoral<br/>responses against the emerging CoVs by aiming<br/>appropriate epitopes and functions of the S protein.<br/>The cross-neutralization ability of SARS-CoV RBD-<br/>specific neutralizing MAbs considerably relies on<br/>the resemblance between their RBDs; therefore,<br/>SARS-CoV RBD-specific antibodies could cross-<br/>neutralized SL CoVs, i.e., bat-SL-CoV strain WIV1<br/>(RBD with eight amino acid differences from SARS-<br/>CoV) but not bat-SL-CoV strain SHCO14 (24 amino<br/>acid differences) (200).<br/><br/>Appropriate RBD-specific MAbs can be<br/>recognized by a relative analysis of RBD of SARS-<br/>CoV-2 to that of SARS-CoV, and cross-neutralizing<br/>SARS-CoV RBD-specific MAbs could be explored<br/>for their effectiveness against COVID-19 and further<br/>need to be assessed clinically. The USS.<br/>biotechnology company Regeneron is attempting to<br/>recognize potent and specific MAbs to combat<br/>COVID-19. An ideal therapeutic option suggested<br/>for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is the combination<br/>therapy comprised of MAbs and the drug remdesivir<br/>(COVID-19) (201). The SARS-CoV-specific human<br/>MAb CR3022 is found to bind with SARS-CoV-2<br/>RBD, indicating its potential as a therapeutic agent
