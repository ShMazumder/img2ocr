results in amino acid substitution of Ser for Lys at residue<br/>84 of the ORF8 protein. Those variants with this muta-<br/>tion make up a single subclade labelled as ‘clade S****.<br/>Currently, however, the available sequence data are not<br/>sufficient to interpret the early global transmission his-<br/>tory of the virus, and travel patterns, founder effects and<br/>public health measures also strongly influence the spread<br/>of particular lineages, irrespective of potential biological<br/>differences between different virus variants.<br/><br/>Animal host and spillover<br/><br/>Bats are important natural hosts of alphacoronavi-<br/>ruses and betacoronaviruses. The closest relative<br/>to SARS-CoV-2 known to date is a bat coronavirus<br/>detected in Rhinolophus affinis from Yunnan province,<br/>China, named ‘RaTG13’, whose full-length genome<br/>sequence is 96.2% identical to that of SARS-CoV-2<br/>(REF."). This bat virus shares more than 90% sequence<br/>identity with SARS-CoV-2 in all ORFs throughout<br/>the genome, including the highly variable S and ORF8<br/>(REF."). Phylogenetic analysis confirms that SARS-CoV-2<br/>closely clusters with RaTG13 (FIG. 2). The high genetic<br/>similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 supports<br/>the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 likely originated from<br/>bats*. Another related coronavirus has been reported<br/><br/>more recently in a Rhinolophus malayanus bat sampled<br/>in Yunnan _ Thic navel hat virne denated ‘RmMYNN?’
