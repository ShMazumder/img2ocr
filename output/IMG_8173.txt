this is both challenging as well as time-consuming<br/>due to the present extent of infection (226). The<br/>current scenario demands effective implementation<br/>of vigorous prevention and control strategies owing<br/>to the prospect of COVID-19 for nosocomial<br/>infections (68). Follow-ups of infected patients by<br/>telephone on day 7 and day 14 are advised to avoid<br/>any further unintentional spread or nosocomial<br/>transmission (312). The availability of public data<br/>sets provided by independent analytical teams will<br/>act as robust evidence that would guide us in<br/>designing interventions against the COVID-19<br/>outbreak. Newspaper reports and social media can be<br/>used to analyze and reconstruct the progression of an<br/>outbreak. They can help us to obtain detailed patient-<br/>level data in the early stages of an outbreak (227).<br/>Immediate travel restrictions imposed by several<br/>countries might have contributed significantly to<br/>preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 globally (89,<br/>228). Following the outbreak, a temporary ban was<br/>imposed on the wildlife trade, keeping in mind the<br/>possible role played by wild animal species in the<br/>origin of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 (147). Making a<br/>permanent and bold decision on the trade of wild<br/>animal species is necessary to prevent the possibility
