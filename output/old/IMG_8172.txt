associated with severe economic impacts globally
due to the sudden interruption of global trade and
supply chains that forced multinational companies to
make decisions that led to significant economic
losses (66). The recent increase in the number of
confirmed critically ill patients with COVID-19 has
already surpassed the intensive care supplies,
limiting intensive care services to only a small
portion of critically ill patients (67). This might also
have contributed to the increased case fatality rate
observed in the COVID-19 outbreak.

Viewpoint on SARS-CoV-2 Transmission,
Spread, and Emergence

The novel coronavirus was identified within 1
month (28 days) of the outbreak. This is impressively
fast compared to the time taken to identify SARS-
CoV reported in Foshan, Guangdong Province,
China (125days) (68). Immediately after the
confirmation of viral etiology, the Chinese
virologists rapidly released the genomic sequence of
SARS-CoV-2, which played a crucial role in
controlling the spread of this newly emerged novel
coronavirus to other parts of the world (69). The
possible origin of SARS-CoV-2 and the first mode of
