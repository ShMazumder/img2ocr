Hence, based on the viral load, we can quickly
evaluate the progression of infection (291). In
addition to all of the above findings, sequencing and
phylogenetics are critical in the correct identification
and confirmation of the causative viral agent and
useful to establish relationships with previous
isolates and sequences, as well as to know, especially
during an epidemic, the nucleotide and amino acid
mutations and the molecular divergence. The rapid
development and implementation of diagnostic tests
against emerging novel diseases like COVID-19
pose significant challenges due to the lack of
resources and logistical limitations associated with
an outbreak (155).

SARS-CoV-2 infection can also be confirmed by
isolation and culturing. The human airway epithelial
cell culture was found to be useful in isolating
SARS-CoV-2 (3). The efficient control of an
outbreak depends on the rapid diagnosis of the
disease. Recently, in response to the COVID-19
outbreak, 1-step quantitative real-time reverse
transcription-PCR assays were developed that detect
the ORF1b and N regions of the SARS-CoV-2
genome (156). That assay was found to achieve the
rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2. Nucleic acid-based
assays offer high accuracy in the diagnosis of SARS-
