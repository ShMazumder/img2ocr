equally as important as the use of appropriate PPE,
like face masks, to break the transmission cycle of
the virus; both hand hygiene and face masks help to
lessen the risk of COVID-19 transmission (315).

Medical staff are in the group of individuals most
at risk of getting COVID-19 infection. This is
because they are exposed directly to infected
patients. Hence, proper training must be given to all
hospital staff on methods of prevention and
protection so that they become competent enough to
protect themselves and others from this deadly
disease (316). As a preventive measure, health care
workers caring for infected patients should take
extreme precautions against both contact and
airborne transmission. They should use PPE such as
face masks (N95 or FFP3), eye protection (goggles),
gowns, and gloves to nullify the risk of infection
(299).

The human-to-human transmission reported in
SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs mainly through
droplet or direct contact. Due to this finding,
frontline health care workers should follow stringent
infection control and preventive measures, such as
the use of PPE, to prevent infection (110). The
mental health of the medical/health workers who are
involved in the COVID-19 outbreak is of great
