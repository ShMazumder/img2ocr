to-human transmission is lacking and _ requires
further studies (332). Rather than waiting for firmer
evidence on animal-to-human transmission,
necessary preventive measures are advised, as well
as following social distancing practices among
companion animals of different households (331).
One of the leading veterinary diagnostic companies,
IDEXX, has conducted large-scale testing for
COVID-19 in specimens collected from dogs and
cats. However, none of the tests turned out to be
positive (334).

In a study conducted to investigate the potential
of different animal species to act as the intermediate
host of SARS-CoV-2, it was found that both ferrets
and cats can be infected via experimental inoculation
of the virus. In addition, infected cats efficiently
transmitted the disease to naive cats (329). SARS-
CoV-2 infection and subsequent transmission in
ferrets were found to recapitulate the clinical aspects
of COVID-19 in humans. The infected ferrets also
shed virus via multiple routes, such as saliva, nasal
washes, feces, and urine, postinfection, making them
an ideal animal model for studying disease
transmission (337). Experimental inoculation was
also done in other animal species and found that the
dogs have low susceptibility, while the chickens,
