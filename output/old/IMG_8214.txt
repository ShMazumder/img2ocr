Even though individuals of all ages and sexes are
susceptible to COVID-19, older people with an
underlying chronic disease are more likely to
become severely infected (80). Recently, individuals
with asymptomatic infection were also found to act
as a source of infection to susceptible individuals
(81). Both the asymptomatic and symptomatic
patients secrete similar viral loads, which indicates
that the transmission capacity of asymptomatic or
minimally symptomatic patients is very high. Thus,
SARS-CoV-2 transmission can happen early in the
course of infection (82). Atypical clinical
manifestations have also been reported in COVID-19
in which the only reporting symptom was fatigue.
Such patients may lack respiratory signs, such as
fever, cough, and sputum (83). Hence, the clinicians
