SARS-CoV-2 invades the lung parenchyma,
resulting in severe interstitial inflammation of the
lungs. This is evident on computed tomography (CT)
images as ground-glass opacity in the lungs. This
lesion initially involves a single lobe but later
expands to multiple lung lobes (118). The
histological assessment of lung biopsy samples
obtained from COVID-19-infected patients revealed
diffuse alveolar damage, cellular fibromyxoid
exudates, hyaline membrane formation, and
desquamation of pneumocytes, indicative of acute
respiratory distress syndrome (119). It was also
found that the SARS-CoV-2-infected patients often
have lymphocytopenia with or without leukocyte
abnormalities. The degree of lymphocytopenia gives
an idea about disease prognosis, as it is found to be
positively correlated with disease severity (118).
Pregnant women are considered to have a higher risk
of getting infected by COVID-19. The coronaviruses
can cause adverse outcomes for the fetus, such as
intrauterine growth restriction, spontaneous abortion,
preterm delivery, and perinatal death.

Nevertheless, the possibility of intrauterine
maternal-fetal transmission (vertical transmission) of
CoVs is low and was not seen during either the
SARS- or MERS-CoV outbreak (120). However,
