by the University of Oxford. In a randomized controlled
phase I/II trial, it induced neutralizing antibodies against
SARS-CoV-2 in all 1,077 participants after a second
vaccine dose, while its safety profile was acceptable as
well’. The NIAID and Moderna co-manufactured
mRNA- 1273, a lipid nanoparticle-formulated mRNA
vaccine candidate that encodes the stabilized prefusion
SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Its immunogenicity has been
confirmed by a phase I trial in which robust neutralizing
antibody responses were induced in a dose-dependent
manner and increased after a second dose'™. Regarding
inactivated vaccines, a successful phase I/II trial involv-
ing 320 participants has been reported in China. The
whole-virus COVID-19 vaccine had a low rate of adverse
reactions and effectively induced neutralizing antibody
production’. The verified safety and immunogenicity
support advancement of these vaccine candidates to
phase III clinical trials, which will evaluate their efficacy
in protecting healthy populations from SARS-CoV-2
infection.

Future perspectives

COVID-19 is the third highly pathogenic human coro-
navirus disease to date. Although less deadly than SARS
and MERS, the rapid spreading of this highly conta-
gious disease has posed the severest threat to global
health in this century. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has
lasted for more than half a year now, and it is likely that
