clustered transmission events, hot spots, and
superspreader potential of SARS-CoV-2/COVID
warrant full exploitation of real-time disease
mapping by employing geographical information
systems (GIS), such as the GIS software Kosmo 3.1,
web-based real-time tools and dashboards, apps, and
advances in information technology (356-359).
Researchers have also developed a few prediction
tools/models, such as the prediction model risk of
bias assessment tool (PROBAST) and critical
appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews
of prediction modeling studies (CHARMS), which
could aid in assessing the possibility of getting
infection and estimating the prognosis in patients;
however, such models may suffer from bias issues
and, hence, cannot be considered completely
trustworthy, which necessitates the development of
new and reliable predictors (360).

VACCINES, THERAPEUTICS, AND
DRUGS

Recently emerged viruses, such as Zika, Ebola,
and Nipah viruses, and their grave threats to humans
have begun a race in exploring the designing and
developing of advanced vaccines, prophylactics,
therapeutics, and drug regimens to counter emerging
