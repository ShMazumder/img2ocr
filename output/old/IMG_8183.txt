CONCLUDING REMARKS

Several years after the global SARS epidemic,
the current SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic has
served as a reminder of how novel pathogens can
rapidly emerge and spread through the human
population and eventually cause severe public health
crises. Further research should be conducted to
establish animal models for SARS-CoV-2_ to
investigate replication, transmission dynamics, and
pathogenesis in humans. This may help develop and
evaluate potential therapeutic strategies against
zoonotic CoV epidemics. Present trends suggest the
occurrence of future outbreaks of CoVs due to
changes in the climate, and ecological conditions
may be associated with human-animal contact. Live-
animal markets, such as the Huanan South China
Seafood Market, represent ideal conditions for
interspecies contact of wildlife with domestic birds,
pigs, and mammals, which substantially increases
the probability of interspecies transmission of CoV
infections and could result in high risks to humans
due to adaptive genetic recombination in these
viruses (323-325).

The COVID-19-associated symptoms are fever,
cough, expectoration, headache, and myalgia or
fatigue. Individuals with asymptomatic and atypical
