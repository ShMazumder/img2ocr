in the management of COVID-19. It can be used
alone or in combination with other effective
neutralizing antibodies for the treatment and
prevention of COVID-19 (202). Furthermore, SARS-
CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, like m396 and
CR3014, failed to bind the S protein of SARS-CoV-
2, indicating that a particular level of similarity is
mandatory between the RBDs of SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 for the cross-reactivity to occur.

Further assessment is necessary before
confirming the effectiveness of such combination
therapy. In addition, to prevent further community
and nosocomial spread of COVID-19, the
postprocedure risk management program should not
be neglected (309). Development of broad-spectrum
inhibitors against the human coronaviral pathogens
will help to facilitate clinical trials on the
effectiveness of such inhibitors against endemic and
emerging coronaviruses (203). A promising animal
study revealed the protective effect of passive
immunotherapy with immune serum from MERS-
immune camels on mice infected with MERS-CoV
(204). Passive immunotherapy using convalescent
plasma is another strategy that can be used for
treating COVID-19-infected, critically ill patients
(205).
