having severe enteritis and belongs to the genus<br/>Alphacoronavirus (106). The outbreak was<br/>associated with considerable scale mortality of<br/>piglets (24,693 deaths) across four farms in China<br/>(134). The virus isolated from the piglets was almost<br/>identical to and had 95% genomic similarity with<br/>horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus species) coronavirus<br/>HKU2, suggesting a bat origin of the pig virus (106,<br/>134, 135). It is also imperative to note that the<br/>SADS-CoV outbreak started in Guangdong province,<br/>near the location of the SARS pandemic origin<br/>(134). Before this outbreak, pigs were not known to<br/>be infected with bat-origin coronaviruses. This<br/>indicates that the bat-origin coronavirus jumped to<br/>pig by breaking the species barrier. The next step of<br/>this jump might not end well, since pigs are<br/>considered the mixing vessel for influenza A viruses<br/>due to their ability to be infected by both human and<br/>avian influenza A viruses (136).<br/><br/>Similarly, they may act as the mixing vessel for<br/>coronaviruses, since they are in frequent contact with<br/>both humans and multiple wildlife species.<br/>Additionally, pigs are also found to be susceptible to<br/>infection with human SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV,<br/>making this scenario a nightmare (109, 137).
