 Besides the important structural proteins, the SARS-CoV-2 genome contains 15 nsps, nspl to nsp10 and nsp12 to nsp16, and 8 accessory proteins (3a, 3b, p6, 7a, 7b, 8b, 9b, and ORF14) (16). All these proteins play a specific role in viral replication (27). Unlike the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 does not contain 8a protein and has a longer 8b and shorter 3b protein (16). The nsp7, nsp13, envelope, matrix, and p6 and 8b accessory proteins have not been detected with any amino acid<br/>substitutions compared to the sequences of other coronaviruses (16).<br/>The virus structure of SARS-CoV-2 is depicted in Fig. 2.<br/>Spike glycoprotein (S) (required for the entry of the infectious virion particle)<br/>Membrane protein (M)<br/>(most abundant viral protein) Major structural proteins<br/>Envelope glycoprotein (E) (smallest among the major structural proteins)<br/>Nucleocapsid protein (N) + single-stranded positive sense RNA genome<br/>Lipid bilayer<br/>FIG 2 SARS-CoV-2 virus structure.
