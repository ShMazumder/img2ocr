including bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities<br/>with a peripheral or posterior distribution''*''’. Thus,<br/>it has been suggested that CT scanning combined<br/>with repeated swab tests should be used for individu-<br/>als with high clinical suspicion of COVID-19 but who<br/>est negative in initial nucleic acid screening'"*. Finally,<br/>SARS-CoV-2 serological tests detecting antibodies to<br/>NorS protein could complement molecular diagnosis,<br/>particularly in late phases after disease onset or for retro-<br/>spective studies''®'*°'?!, However, the extent and dura-<br/>ion of immune responses are still unclear, and available<br/>serological tests differ in their sensitivity and specific-<br/>ity, all of which need to be taken into account when<br/>one is deciding on serological tests and interpreting<br/>their results or potentially in the future test for T cell<br/>responses.<br/><br/>Therapeutics<br/><br/>To date, there are no generally proven effective thera-<br/>pies for COVID-19 or antivirals against SARS-CoV-2,<br/>although some treatments have shown some benefits<br/>in certain subpopulations of patients or for certain end<br/>points (see later). Researchers and manufacturers are<br/>conducting large-scale clinical trials to evaluate var-<br/>ious therapies for COVID-19. As of 2 October 2020,<br/>there were about 405 therapeutic drugs in development<br/>for COVID-19, and nearly 318 in human clinical trials<br/>(COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutics tracker). In the<br/>following sections, we summarize potential therapeutics<br/>against SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of published clinical<br/>data and experience.
