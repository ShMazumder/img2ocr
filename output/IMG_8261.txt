humans manifests itself as mild symptoms to severe<br/>respiratory failure. On binding to epithelial cells in<br/>the respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 starts replicating<br/>and migrating down to the airways and enters alveo-<br/>lar epithelial cells in the lungs. The rapid replication of<br/>SARS-CoV-2 in the lungs may trigger a strong immune<br/>response. Cytokine storm syndrome causes acute res-<br/>piratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure, which<br/>is considered the main cause of death in patients with<br/>COVID-19 (REFS*”"!). Patients of older age (>60 years)<br/>and with serious pre-existing diseases have a greater risk<br/>of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome and<br/>death" (FIG. 4). Multiple organ failure has also been<br/>reported in some COVID-19 cases**.<br/>Histopathological changes in patients with COVID-19<br/>occur mainly in the lungs. Histopathology analyses<br/>showed bilateral diffused alveolar damage, hyaline<br/>membrane formation, desquamation of pneumocytes<br/>and fibrin deposits in lungs of patients with severe<br/>COVID-19. Exudative inflammation was also shown<br/>in some cases. Immunohistochemistry assays detected<br/>SARS-CoV-2 antigen in the upper airway, bronchiolar<br/>epithelium and submucosal gland epithelium, as well as<br/>in type I and type II pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages<br/>and hyaline membranes in the lungs'*"”,<br/><br/>Animal models used for studying SARS-CoV-2<br/>infection pathogenesis include non-human primates<br/>(rhesus macaques, cynomolgus monkeys, marmosets<br/>and African green monkeys), mice (wild-type mice (with<br/>mouse-adapted virus) and human ACE2-transgenic<br/>or human ACE2-knock-in mice), ferrets and golden<br/>hamsters*“**-“.
