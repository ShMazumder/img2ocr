metapneumovirus and SARS coronavirus. It is<br/>advisable to distinguish COVID-19 from other<br/>pneumonias such as mycoplasma pneumonia,<br/>chlamydia pneumonia and bacterial<br/>pneumonia.*? Several published pieces of<br/>literature based on the novel coronavirus<br/>reported in China declared that stool and blood<br/>samples can also collected from the suspected<br/>persons in order to detect the virus. However,<br/>respiratory samples show better viability in<br/>identifying the virus, in comparison with the<br/>other specimens.**-*°<br/><br/>6.2 Nucleic acid amplification tests<br/>(NAAT) for COVID-19 virus<br/><br/>The gold standard method of confirming the<br/>suspected cases of COVID-19 is carried out by<br/>detecting the unique sequences of virus RNA<br/>through reverse transcription polymerase chain<br/>reaction (RT-PCR) along with nucleic acid<br/>sequencing if needed. The various genes of<br/>virus identified so far include N, E, S (N:<br/>nucleocapsid protein, E: envelope protein gene,<br/>S: spike protein gene) and RdRP genes (RNA-<br/>dependent RNA polymerase gene).°*
