CoV-2 (329).<br/><br/>Similarly, the National Veterinary Services<br/>Laboratories of the USDA have reported COVID-19<br/>in tigers and lions that exhibited respiratory signs<br/>like dry cough and wheezing. The zoo animals are<br/>suspected to have been infected by an asymptomatic<br/>zookeeper (335). The total number of COVID-19-<br/>positive cases in human beings is increasing at a high<br/>rate, thereby creating ideal conditions for viral<br/>spillover to other species, such as pigs. The evidence<br/>obtained from SARS-CoV suggests that pigs can get<br/>infected with SARS-CoV-2 (336). However,<br/>experimental inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 failed to<br/>infect pigs (329).<br/><br/>Further studies are required to identify the<br/>possible animal reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 and the<br/>seasonal variation in the circulation of these viruses<br/>in the animal population. Research collaboration<br/>between human and animal health sectors is<br/>becoming a necessity to evaluate and identify the<br/>possible risk factors of transmission between animals<br/>and humans. Such cooperation will help to devise<br/>efficient strategies for the management of emerging<br/>zoonotic diseases (12).
