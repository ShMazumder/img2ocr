CoV-2 strains, the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Resource<br/>of China National Center for Bioinformation aligned<br/>77,801 genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 detected glob-<br/>ally and identified a total of 15,018 mutations, including<br/>14,824 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (BIGD)*'.<br/>In the S protein, four amino acid alterations, V483A,<br/>L455I, F456V and G4765, are located near the binding<br/>interface in the RBD, but their effects on binding to the<br/>host receptor are unknown. The alteration D614G in<br/>the S1 subunit was found far more frequently than other<br/>S variant sites, and it is the marker of a major subclade of<br/>SARS-CoV-2 (clade G). Since March 2020, SARS-CoV-2<br/>variants with G614 in the S protein have replaced the<br/>original D614 variants and become the dominant form<br/>circulating globally. Compared with the D614 variant,<br/>higher viral loads were found in patients infected with<br/>the G614 variant, but clinical data suggested no signif-<br/>icant link between the D614G alteration and disease<br/>severityâ€™. Pseudotyped viruses carrying the S protein<br/>with G614 generated higher infectious titres than viruses<br/>carrying the S protein with D614, suggesting the altera-<br/>tion may have increased the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2<br/>(REF). However, the results of in vitro experiments based<br/>on pseudovirus models may not exactly reflect natural<br/>infection. This preliminary finding should be validated<br/>by more studies using wild-type SARS-CoV-2 variants to<br/>infect different target cells and animal models. Whether<br/>this amino acid change enhanced virus transmissibil-<br/>ity is also to be determined. Another marker mutation<br/>for SARS-CoV-2 evolution is the single-nucleotide
