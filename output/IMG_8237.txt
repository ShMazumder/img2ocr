superspreader potential of SARS-CoV-2/COVID<br/>warrant full exploitation of real-time disease<br/>mapping by employing geographical information<br/>systems (GIS), such as the GIS software Kosmo 3.1,<br/>web-based real-time tools and dashboards, apps, and<br/>advances in information technology (356-359).<br/>Researchers have also developed a few prediction<br/>tools/models, such as the prediction model risk of<br/>bias assessment tool (PROBAST) and critical<br/>appraisal and data extraction for systematic reviews<br/>of prediction modeling studies (CHARMS), which<br/>could aid in assessing the possibility of getting<br/>infection and estimating the prognosis in patients;<br/>however, such models may suffer from bias issues<br/>and, hence, cannot be considered completely<br/>trustworthy, which necessitates the development of<br/>new and reliable predictors (360).<br/><br/>VACCINES, THERAPEUTICS, AND<br/>DRUGS<br/><br/>Recently emerged viruses, such as Zika, Ebola,<br/>and Nipah viruses, and their grave threats to humans<br/>have begun a race in exploring the designing and<br/>developing of advanced vaccines, prophylactics,<br/>therapeutics, and drug regimens to counter emerging
