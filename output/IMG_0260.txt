immunotherapeutics, and antiviral drugs, have been<br/>exploited against the previous CoV _ outbreaks<br/>(SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) (8, 104, 164-167).<br/>These valuable options have already been evaluated<br/>for their potency, efficacy, and safety, along with<br/>several other types of current research that will fuel<br/>our search for ideal therapeutic agents against<br/>COVID-19 (7, 9, 19, 21, 36). The primary cause of<br/>the unavailability of approved and commercial<br/>vaccines, drugs, and therapeutics to counter the<br/>earlier SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV seems to owe to<br/>the lesser attention of the biomedicine and<br/>pharmaceutical companies, as these two CoVs did<br/>not cause much havoc, global threat, and panic like<br/>those posed by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (19).<br/>Moreover, for such outbreak situations, the<br/>requirement for vaccines and_ therapeutics/drugs<br/>exists only for a limited period, until the outbreak is<br/>controlled. The proportion of the human population<br/>infected with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV was also<br/>much lower across the globe, failing to attract drug<br/>and vaccine manufacturers and producers. Therefore,<br/>by the time an effective drug or vaccine is designed<br/>against such disease outbreaks, the virus would have<br/>been controlled by adopting appropriate and strict
