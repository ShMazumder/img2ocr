many different animals, and they can cause mild to<br/>severe respiratory infections in humans. In 2002 and<br/>2012, respectively, two highly pathogenic coronaviruses<br/>with zoonotic origin, severe acute respiratory syndrome<br/>coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory<br/>syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), emerged in<br/>humans and caused fatal respiratory illness, making<br/>emerging coronaviruses a new public health concern<br/>in the twenty-first century’. At the end of 2019, a novel<br/>coronavirus designated as SARS-CoV-2 emerged in the<br/>city of Wuhan, China, and caused an outbreak of unusual<br/>viral pneumonia. Being highly transmissible, this novel<br/>coronavirus disease, also known as coronavirus disease<br/>2019 (COVID-19), has spread fast all over the world*’.<br/>it has overwhelmingly surpassed SARS and MERS in<br/>erms of both the number of infected people and the<br/>spatial range of epidemic areas. The ongoing outbreak of<br/>COVID-19 has posed an extraordinary threat to global<br/>public health*». In this Review, we summarize the cur-<br/>rent understanding of the nature of SARS-CoV-2 and<br/>COVID-19. On the basis of recently published findings,<br/>his comprehensive Review covers the basic biology<br/>of SARS-CoV-2, including the genetic characteristics,<br/>the potential zoonotic origin and its receptor binding.<br/>Furthermore, we will discuss the clinical and epide-<br/>miological features, diagnosis of and countermeasures<br/>against COVID-19.<br/><br/>Emergence and spread<br/>In late December 2019, several health facilities in<br/>Wuhan, in Hubei province in China, reported clusters of<br/>patients with pneumonia of unknown cause’. Similarly<br/>to patients with SARS and MERS, these patients showed<br/>symptoms of viral pneumonia, including fever, cough
