humans. The broad-spectrum activity exhibited by<br/>remdesivir will help control the spread of disease in<br/>the event of a new coronavirus outbreak.<br/>Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug known to<br/>possess antiviral activity due to its ability to block<br/>virus-cell fusion by raising the endosomal pH<br/>necessary for fusion. It also interferes with virus-<br/>receptor binding by interfering with the terminal<br/>glycosylation of SARS-CoV cellular receptors, such<br/>as ACE2 (196). In a recent multicenter clinical trial<br/>that was conducted in China, chloroquine phosphate<br/>was found to exhibit both efficacy and safety in the<br/>therapeutic management of SARS-CoV-2-associated<br/>pneumonia (197). This drug is already included in<br/>the treatment guidelines issued by the National<br/>Health Commission of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of<br/>China. The preliminary clinical trials using<br/>hydroxychloroquine, another aminoquinoline drug,<br/>gave promising results. The COVID-19 patients<br/>received 600 mg of hydroxychloroquine daily along<br/>with azithromycin as a single-arm protocol. This<br/>protocol was found to be associated with a<br/>noteworthy reduction in viral load. Finally, it<br/>resulted in a complete cure (271); however, the study<br/>comprised a small population and, hence, the
