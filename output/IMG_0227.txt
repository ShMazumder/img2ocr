On 31 December, Wuhan Municipal Health<br/>Commission notified the public of a pneumonia out:<br/>break of unidentified cause and informed the Worl¢<br/>Health Organization (WHO) (FIG. 1).<br/><br/>By metagenomic RNA sequencing and virus isola.<br/>tion from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from<br/>patients with severe pneumonia, independent teams<br/>of Chinese scientists identified that the causative agent o:<br/>this emerging disease is a betacoronavirus that had never<br/>been seen before®!"'. On 9 January 2020, the result o:<br/>this etiological identification was publicly announcec¢<br/>(FIG. 1). The first genome sequence of the novel coro-<br/>navirus was published on the Virological website or<br/>10 January, and more nearly complete genome sequences<br/>determined by different research institutes were ther<br/>released via the GISAID database on 12 January’<br/>Later, more patients with no history of exposure tc<br/>Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market were identified<br/>Several familial clusters of infection were reported.<br/>and nosocomial infection also occurred in health-care<br/>acilities.
