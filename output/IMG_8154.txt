conserved replicative domains in pplab (3C-like protease<br/>(3CLpro), nidovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase<br/>(RdRp)-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN),<br/>RdRp, zinc-binding domain (ZBD) and HELI), the<br/>Coronaviridae Study Group of the International<br/>Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses estimated the<br/>pairwise patristic distances between SARS-CoV-2 and<br/>known coronaviruses, and assigned SARS-CoV-2 to<br/>the existing species SARSr-CoV‚Äù. Although phyloge-<br/>netically related, SARS-CoV-2 is distinct from all other<br/>coronaviruses from bats and pangolins in this species.<br/>The SARS-CoV-2 S protein has a full size of<br/>1,273 amino acids, longer than that of SARS-CoV<br/>(1,255 amino acids) and known bat SARSr-CoVs<br/>(1,245-1,269 amino acids). It is distinct from the S pro-<br/>teins of most members in the subgenus Sarbecovirus,<br/>sharing amino acid sequence similarities of 76.7-<br/>77.0% with SARS-CoVs from civets and humans,
