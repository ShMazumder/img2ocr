monia and humoral and cellular immune responses<br/>were observed**’’. Moreover, prolonged virus shedding<br/>peaked early in the course of infection in asymptomatic<br/>macaques”, and old monkeys showed severer intersti-<br/>tial pneumonia than young monkeys’*, which is similar<br/>to what is seen in patients with COVID-19. In human<br/>ACE2-transgenic mice infected with SARS-CoV-2, typ-<br/>ical interstitial pneumonia was present, and viral anti-<br/>gens were observed mainly in the bronchial epithelial<br/>cells, macrophages and alveolar epithelia. Some human<br/>ACE2-transgenic mice even died after infection”.<br/>In wide-type mice, a SARS-CoV-2 mouse-adapted strain<br/>with the N501Y alteration in the RBD of the S protein<br/>was generated at passage 6. Interstitial pneumonia and<br/>inflammatory responses were found in both young<br/>and aged mice after infection with the mouse-adapted<br/>strain’’. Golden hamsters also showed typical symptoms<br/>after being infected with SARS-CoV-2 (REF.”). In other<br/>animal models, including cats and ferrets, SARS-CoV-2<br/>could efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory trac<br/>but did not induce severe clinical symptoms**”. As trans-<br/>mission by direct contact and air was observed in infected<br/>ferrets and hamsters, these animals could be used to<br/>model different transmission modes of COVID-19<br/>(REFS’~-”®), Animal models offer important information<br/>for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2<br/>infection and the transmission dynamics of SARS-<br/>CoV-2, and are important to evaluate the efficacy of<br/>antiviral therapeutics and vaccines.<br/><br/>Clinical and epidemiological features<br/><br/>It appears that all ages of the population are susceptible to<br/>SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the median age of infection<br/>is around 50 years”'***!, However, clinical manifesta-<br/>tions differ with age. In general, older men (>60 years<br/>old) with co-morbidities are more likely to develop<br/>severe respiratory disease that requires hospitalization
