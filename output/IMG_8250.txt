experiments. There is an enhanced nasal<br/>secretion observed along with local oedema<br/>because of the damage of the host cell, which<br/>further stimulates the synthesis of<br/>inflammatory mediators. In addition, these<br/>reactions can induce sneezing, difficulty<br/>breathing by causing airway inhibition and<br/>elevate mucosal temperature. These viruses,<br/>when released, chiefly affect the lower<br/>respiratory tract, with the signs and symptoms<br/>existing clinically. Also, the virus further affects<br/>the intestinal lymphocytes, renal cells, liver cells<br/>and T-lymphocytes. Furthermore, the virus<br/>induces T-cell apoptosis, causing the reaction of<br/>the T-cell to be erratic, resulting in the immune<br/>system's complete collapse.** 7°<br/><br/>5.1 Mode of transmission<br/><br/>In fact it was accepted that the original<br/>transmission originated from a seafood market,<br/>which had a tradition of selling live animals,<br/>where the majority of the patients had either<br/>worked or visited, although up to now the<br/>understanding of the COVID-19 transmission<br/>risk remains incomplete.'° In addition, while the<br/>newer patients had no exposure to the market<br/>and still got the virus from the humans present<br/>there, there is an increase in the outbreak of
