experiments. There is an enhanced nasal secretion observed along with local oedema because of the damage of the host cell, which further stimulates the synthesis of inflammatory mediators. In addition, these reactions can induce sneezing, difficulty breathing by causing airway inhibition and elevate mucosal temperature. These viruses, when released, chiefly affect the lower respiratory tract, with the signs and symptoms existing clinically. Also, the virus further affects the intestinal lymphocytes, renal cells, liver cells and T-lymphocytes. Furthermore, the virus induces T-cell apoptosis, causing the reaction of the T-cell to be erratic, resulting in the immune system's complete collapse.** 7°<br/>5.1 Mode of transmission<br/>In fact it was accepted that the original transmission originated from a seafood market, which had a tradition of selling live animals, where the majority of the patients had either worked or visited, although up to now the understanding of the COVID-19 transmission risk remains incomplete.'° In addition, while the newer patients had no exposure to the market and still got the virus from the humans present there, there is an increase in the outbreak of
