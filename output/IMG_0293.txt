appears to be very similar to that of the SARS-<br/>CoV and it is believed that the same receptor<br/>would be used for cell entry. |<br/><br/>4.1 Virion structure and its<br/>genome<br/><br/>Coronaviruses are structurally enveloped,<br/>belonging to the positive-strand RNA viruses<br/>category that has the largest known genomes of<br/>RNA. The structures of the coronavirus are<br/>more spherical in shape, but their structure has<br/>the potential to modify their morphology in<br/>response to environmental conditions, being<br/>pleomorphic. The capsular membrane which<br/>represents the outer envelope usually has<br/>glycoprotein projection and covers the nucleus,<br/>comprising a matrix protein containing a<br/>positive-strand RNA. Since the structure<br/>possesses 5'-capped and 3'-polyadenylated<br/>ends, it remains identical to the cellular<br/>mRNAs.'Â® The structure is comprised of<br/>hemagglutinin esterase (HE) (present only in<br/>some beta-coronaviruses), spike (S), small<br/>membrane (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid<br/>(N), as shown (Figure 1). The envelope<br/>containing glycoprotein is responsible for<br/>attachment to the host cell, which possesses the<br/>primary anti-genic epitopes mainly those
