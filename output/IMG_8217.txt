zoonotic spillover (1). Personal protective equipment (PPE), like face masks, will help to prevent the spread of respiratory infections like COVID-19. Face masks not only protect from infectious aerosols but also prevent the transmission of disease to other susceptible individuals while traveling through public transport systems (313). Another critical practice that can reduce the transmission of respiratory diseases 1s the maintenance of hand hygiene. However, the efficacy of this practice in reducing the transmission of respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 is much dependent upon the size of droplets produced. Hand hygiene will reduce disease transmission only if the virus is transmitted through the formation of large droplets (314). Hence, it is better not to overemphasize that hand hygiene will prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, since it may produce a false sense of safety among the general public that further contributes to the spread of COVID-19. Even though airborne spread has not been reported in SARS-CoV-2 infection, transmission can occur through droplets and fomites, especially when there is close, unprotected contact between infected and susceptible individuals. Hence, hand hygiene is
