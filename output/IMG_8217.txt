zoonotic spillover (1).<br/><br/>Personal protective equipment (PPE), like face<br/>masks, will help to prevent the spread of respiratory<br/>infections like COVID-19. Face masks not only<br/>protect from infectious aerosols but also prevent the<br/>transmission of disease to other susceptible<br/>individuals while traveling through public transport<br/>systems (313). Another critical practice that can<br/>reduce the transmission of respiratory diseases 1s the<br/>maintenance of hand hygiene. However, the efficacy<br/>of this practice in reducing the transmission of<br/>respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2 is much<br/>dependent upon the size of droplets produced. Hand<br/>hygiene will reduce disease transmission only if the<br/>virus is transmitted through the formation of large<br/>droplets (314). Hence, it is better not to<br/>overemphasize that hand hygiene will prevent the<br/>transmission of SARS-CoV-2, since it may produce a<br/>false sense of safety among the general public that<br/>further contributes to the spread of COVID-19. Even<br/>though airborne spread has not been reported in<br/>SARS-CoV-2 infection, transmission can occur<br/>through droplets and fomites, especially when there<br/>is close, unprotected contact between infected and<br/>susceptible individuals. Hence, hand hygiene is
