approach may play a vital role in the prevention and<br/>control measures being followed to restrain this<br/>pandemic virus (317-319). The Â© substantial<br/>importation of COVID-19 presymptomatic cases<br/>from Wuhan has resulted in independent, self-<br/>sustaining outbreaks across major cities both within<br/>the country and across the globe. The majority of<br/>Chinese cities are now facing localized outbreaks of<br/>COVID-19 (231). Hence, deploying efficient public<br/>health interventions might help to cut the spread of<br/>this virus globally.<br/><br/>The occurrence of COVID-19 infection on<br/>several cruise ships gave us a preliminary idea<br/>regarding the transmission pattern of the disease.<br/>Cruise ships act as a closed environment and provide<br/>an ideal setting for the occurrence of respiratory<br/>disease outbreaks. Such a situation poses a<br/>significant threat to travelers, since people from<br/>different countries are on board, which favors the<br/>introduction of the pathogen (320). Although nearly<br/>30 cruise ships from different countries have been<br/>found harboring COVID-19 infection, the major<br/>cruise ships that were involved in the COVID-19<br/>outbreaks are the Diamond Princess, Grand<br/>Princess, Celebrity Apex, and Ruby Princess.
