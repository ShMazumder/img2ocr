The virus can remain<br/>viable on surfaces for days in<br/>favourable atmospheric conditions but<br/>are destroyed in less than a minute by<br/>common disinfectants like sodium<br/>hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide etc.<br/>[13]. Infection is acquired either by<br/>inhalation of these droplets or touching<br/>surfaces contaminated by them and<br/>then touching the nose, mouth and<br/>eyes. The virus is also present in the<br/>stool and contamination of the water<br/>supply and subsequent transmission<br/>via aerosolization/feco oral route is<br/>also hypothesized [6]. As per current<br/>information, transplacental<br/>transmission from pregnant women to<br/>their fetus has not been described [14].<br/>However, neonatal disease due to post<br/>natal transmission is described [14].<br/>The incubation period varies from 2 to<br/>14 d [median 5 d].
