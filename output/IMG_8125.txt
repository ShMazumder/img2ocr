potential risk for the reemergence of SARS-CoV<br/>infection from the viruses that are currently<br/>circulating in the bat population (105).<br/><br/>CLINICAL PATHOLOGY OF SARS-CoV-2<br/><br/>(COVID-19)<br/><br/>The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is also<br/>named severe specific contagious pneumonia<br/>(SSCP), Wuhan pneumonia, and, recently, COVID-<br/>19 (110). Compared to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2<br/>has less severe pathogenesis but has superior<br/>transmission capability, as evidenced by the rapidly<br/>increasing number of COVID-19 cases (111). The<br/>incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 in familial<br/>clusters was found to be 3 to 6 days (112). The mean<br/>incubation period of COVID-19 was found to be 6.4<br/>days, ranging from 2.1 to 11.1 days (113). Among an<br/>early affected group of 425 patients, 59 years was the<br/>median age, of which more males were affected<br/>(114). Similar to SARS and MERS, the severity of<br/>this nCoV is high in age groups above 50 years (2,<br/>115). Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough,<br/>myalgia or fatigue, and, less commonly, headache,<br/>hemoptysis, and diarrhea (116, 282). Compared to<br/>the SARS-CoV-2-infected patients in Wuhan during
