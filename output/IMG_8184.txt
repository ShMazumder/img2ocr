phase I/II trial, it induced neutralizing antibodies against<br/>SARS-CoV-2 in all 1,077 participants after a second<br/>vaccine dose, while its safety profile was acceptable as<br/>well’. The NIAID and Moderna co-manufactured<br/>mRNA- 1273, a lipid nanoparticle-formulated mRNA<br/>vaccine candidate that encodes the stabilized prefusion<br/>SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Its immunogenicity has been<br/>confirmed by a phase I trial in which robust neutralizing<br/>antibody responses were induced in a dose-dependent<br/>manner and increased after a second dose'™. Regarding<br/>inactivated vaccines, a successful phase I/II trial involv-<br/>ing 320 participants has been reported in China. The<br/>whole-virus COVID-19 vaccine had a low rate of adverse<br/>reactions and effectively induced neutralizing antibody<br/>production’. The verified safety and immunogenicity<br/>support advancement of these vaccine candidates to<br/>phase III clinical trials, which will evaluate their efficacy<br/>in protecting healthy populations from SARS-CoV-2<br/>infection.<br/><br/>Future perspectives<br/><br/>COVID-19 is the third highly pathogenic human coro-<br/>navirus disease to date. Although less deadly than SARS<br/>and MERS, the rapid spreading of this highly conta-<br/>gious disease has posed the severest threat to global<br/>health in this century. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has<br/>lasted for more than half a year now, and it is likely that
