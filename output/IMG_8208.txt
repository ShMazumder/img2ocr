Owing to these residue<br/>changes, interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with its receptor<br/>stabilizes the two virus-binding hotspots on the surface<br/><br/>of hACE2 (REF. (FIG. 3d). Moreover, a<br/>in the RBM of SARS-CoV-2 (amin<br/>G-V-E-G) results in a more compac<br/>its hACE2-binding ridge than in SA<br/><br/>our-residue motif<br/>0 acids 482-485:<br/>conformation of<br/>RS-CoV and ena-<br/><br/>bles better contact with the N-terminal helix of hACE2<br/>REF.*°). Biochemical data confirmed that the structural<br/>eatures of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD has strengthened<br/>its hACE2 binding affinity compared with that of<br/>SARS-CoV,<br/><br/>Similarly to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 needs<br/>proteolytic processing of the S protein to activate the<br/>ocytic route. It has been shown that host proteases<br/>icipate in the cleavage of the S protein and activate<br/>entry of SARS-CoV-2, including transmembrane<br/>ease serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), cathepsin L and<br/>in‘”*5, Single-cell RNA sequencing data showed<br/>TMPRSS2 is highly expressed in several tissues<br/>body sites and is co-expressed with ACE2 in nasal<br/>helial cells, lungs and bronchial branches, which<br/>explains some of the tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2<br/>(REFS°*®*’), SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus entry assays<br/>revealed that TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L have cumu-<br/>lative effects with furin on activating virus entry™.<br/><br/>Analysis of the cryo-electron microscopy structure of<br/>SARS-CoV-2 S protein revealed that its RBD is mostly in<br/>the lying-down state, whereas the SARS-CoV S protein<br/>assumes equally standing-up and lying-down conforma-<br/>tional states®*'***’, A lying-down conformation of the<br/>SARS-CoV-2 S protein may not be in favour of receptor<br/>binding but is helpful for immune evasion”.
