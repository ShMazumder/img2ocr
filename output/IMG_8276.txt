occur directly from the reservoir host to humans<br/>without RBD adaptations. The bat coronavirus that is<br/>currently in circulation maintains specific “poised”<br/>spike proteins that facilitate human infection without<br/>the requirement of any mutations or adaptations<br/>(105). Altogether, different species of bats carry a<br/>massive number of coronaviruses around the world<br/>(106).<br/><br/>The high plasticity in receptor usage, along with<br/>the feasibility of adaptive mutation and<br/>recombination, may result in frequent interspecies<br/>transmission of coronavirus from bats to animals and<br/>humans (106). The pathogenesis of most bat<br/>coronaviruses is unknown, as most of these viruses<br/>are not isolated and studied (4). Hedgehog<br/>coronavirus HKU31, a Betacoronavirus, has been<br/>identified from amur hedgehogs in China. Studies<br/>show that hedgehogs are the reservoir of<br/>Betacoronavirus, and there is evidence of<br/>recombination (107).<br/><br/>The current scientific evidence available on<br/>MERS infection suggests that the significant<br/>reservoir host, as well as the animal source of MERS<br/>infection in humans, is the dromedary camels (97).<br/>The infected dromedary camels may not show any<br/><br/>‘ible ¢; © infact king it challengi
