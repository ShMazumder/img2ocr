collection (310). At present, treatment for sepsis and<br/>ARDS mainly involves antimicrobial therapy, source<br/>control, and supportive care. Hence, the use of<br/>therapeutic plasma exchange can be considered an<br/>option in managing such severe conditions. Further<br/>randomized trials can be designed to investigate its<br/>efficacy (311).<br/><br/>Potential Therapeutic Agents<br/><br/>Potent therapeutics to combat SARS-CoV-2<br/>infection include virus binding molecules, molecules<br/>or inhibitors targeting particular enzymes implicated<br/>in replication and transcription process of the virus,<br/>helicase inhibitors, vital viral proteases and proteins,<br/>protease inhibitors of host cells, endocytosis<br/>inhibitors, short interfering RNA _ (siRNA),<br/>neutralizing antibodies, MAbs against the host<br/>receptor, MAbs interfering with the Sl RBD,<br/>antiviral peptide aimed at S2, and _ natural<br/>drugs/medicines (7, 166, 186). The S protein acts as<br/>the critical target for developing CoV antivirals, like<br/>inhibitors of S protein and S cleavage, neutralizing<br/>antibodies, RBD-ACE2 blockers, siRNAs, blockers<br/>of the fusion core, and proteases (168).<br/><br/>All of these therapeutic approaches have revealed
