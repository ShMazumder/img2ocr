Of the four structural genes, SARS-CoV-2 shares more<br/>than 90% amino acid identity with SARS-CoV except<br/>for the S gene, which diverges''’. The replicase gene<br/>covers two thirds of the 5’ genome, and encodes a large<br/>polyprotein (pplab),which is proteolytically cleaved into<br/>16 non-structural proteins that are involved in transcrip-<br/>tion and virus replication. Most of these SARS-CoV-2<br/>non-structural proteins have greater than 85% amino<br/>acid sequence identity with SARS-CoV”.<br/><br/>The phylogenetic analysis for the whole genome<br/>shows that SARS-CoV-2 is clustered with SARS-CoV<br/>and SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) found<br/>in bats, placing it in the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the<br/>genus Betacoronavirus. Within this clade, SARS-CoV-2<br/>is grouped in a distinct lineage together with four horse-<br/>shoe bat coronavirus isolates (RaTG13, RmYN02, ZC45<br/>and ZXC21) as well as novel coronaviruses recently iden-<br/>tified in pangolins, which group parallel to SARS-CoV
