Of the four structural genes, SARS-CoV-2 shares more than 90% amino acid identity with SARS-CoV except for the S gene, which diverges''’. The replicase gene covers two thirds of the 5’ genome, and encodes a large polyprotein (pplab),which is proteolytically cleaved into 16 non-structural proteins that are involved in transcrip- tion and virus replication. Most of these SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins have greater than 85% amino acid sequence identity with SARS-CoV”. The phylogenetic analysis for the whole genome shows that SARS-CoV-2 is clustered with SARS-CoV and SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) found in bats, placing it in the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus. Within this clade, SARS-CoV-2 is grouped in a distinct lineage together with four horse- shoe bat coronavirus isolates (RaTG13, RmYN02, ZC45 and ZXC21) as well as novel coronaviruses recently iden- tified in pangolins, which group parallel to SARS-CoV
