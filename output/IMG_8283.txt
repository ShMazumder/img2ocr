associated with known emerging viruses, higher
pathogenicity of a virus is often associated with
lower transmissibility. Compared to emerging
viruses like Ebola virus, avian H7N9, SARS-CoV,
and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has relatively lower
pathogenicity and moderate transmissibility (15).
The risk of death among individuals infected with
COVID-19 was calculated using the infection
fatality risk (IFR). The IFR was found to be in the
range of 0.3% to 0.6%, which is comparable to that
of a previous Asian influenza pandemic (1957 to
1958) (73, 277).

Notably, the reanalysis of the COVID-19
pandemic curve from the initial cluster of cases
pointed to considerable human-to-human
transmission. It is opined that the exposure history of
SARS-CoV-2 at the Wuhan seafood market
originated from human-to-human transmission rather
than animal-to-human transmission (74); however, in
light of the zoonotic spillover in COVID-19, is too
early to fully endorse this idea (1). Following the
initial infection, human-to-human transmission has
been observed with a preliminary reproduction
number (Ro) estimate of 1.4 to 2.5 (70, 75), and
recently it is estimated to be 2.24 to 3.58 (76). In
another study, the average reproductive number of
