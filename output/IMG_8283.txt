pathogenicity of a virus is often associated with<br/>lower transmissibility. Compared to emerging<br/>viruses like Ebola virus, avian H7N9, SARS-CoV,<br/>and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has relatively lower<br/>pathogenicity and moderate transmissibility (15).<br/>The risk of death among individuals infected with<br/>COVID-19 was calculated using the infection<br/>fatality risk (IFR). The IFR was found to be in the<br/>range of 0.3% to 0.6%, which is comparable to that<br/>of a previous Asian influenza pandemic (1957 to<br/>1958) (73, 277).<br/><br/>Notably, the reanalysis of the COVID-19<br/>pandemic curve from the initial cluster of cases<br/>pointed to considerable human-to-human<br/>transmission. It is opined that the exposure history of<br/>SARS-CoV-2 at the Wuhan seafood market<br/>originated from human-to-human transmission rather<br/>than animal-to-human transmission (74); however, in<br/>light of the zoonotic spillover in COVID-19, is too<br/>early to fully endorse this idea (1). Following the<br/>initial infection, human-to-human transmission has<br/>been observed with a preliminary reproduction<br/>number (Ro) estimate of 1.4 to 2.5 (70, 75), and<br/>recently it is estimated to be 2.24 to 3.58 (76). In<br/>another study, the average reproductive number of
