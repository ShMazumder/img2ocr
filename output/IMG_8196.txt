CoV-2 is considered a new _ Betacoronavirus<br/>belonging to the subgenus Sarbecovirus (3). A few<br/>other critical zoonotic viruses (MERS-related CoV<br/>and SARS-related CoV) belong to the same genus.<br/>However, SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a distinct<br/>virus based on the percent identity with other<br/>Betacoronavirus; conserved open reading frame 1la/b<br/>(ORF 1a/b) is below 90% identity (3). An overall<br/>80% nucleotide identity was observed between<br/>SARS-CoV-2 and the original SARS-CoV, along<br/>with 89% identity with ZC45 and ZXC21 SARS-<br/>related CoVs of bats (2, 31, 36). In addition, 82%<br/>identity has been observed between SARS-CoV-2<br/>and human SARS-CoV Tor2 and human SARS-CoV<br/>BJO1 2003 (31). A sequence identity of only 51.8%<br/>was observed between MERS-related CoV and the<br/>recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 (37). Phylogenetic<br/>analysis of the structural genes also revealed that<br/>SARS-CoV-2 is closer to bat SARS-related CoV.<br/>Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 might have originated from<br/>bats, while other amplifier hosts might have played a<br/>role in disease transmission to humans (31). Of note,<br/>the other two zoonotic CoVs (MERS-related CoV<br/>and SARS-related CoV) also originated from bats<br/>(38, 39). Nevertheless, for SARS and MERS, civet
