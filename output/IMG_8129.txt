to 8 days after infection, and a few naive ferrets with only<br/>indirect contact were positive for viral RNA, suggest-<br/>ing airborne transmission”. In addition, transmission<br/>of the virus through the ocular surface and prolonged<br/>presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in faecal samples<br/>were also documented'*'"’. Coronaviruses can persist<br/>on inanimate surfaces for days, which could also be the<br/>case for SARS-CoV-2 and could pose a prolonged risk of<br/>infection”. These findings explain the rapid geographic<br/>spread of COVID-19, and public health interventions to<br/>reduce transmission will provide benefit to mitigate the<br/>epidemic, as has proved successful in China and several<br/>other countries, such as South Korea*?!°4!°,<br/><br/>Diagnosis<br/><br/>Early diagnosis is crucial for controlling the spread of<br/>COVID-19. Molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic<br/>acid is the gold standard. Many viral nucleic acid detec-<br/>tion kits targeting ORF1b (including RdRp), N, E or<br/>S genes are commercially available'"'°~'”. The detection<br/>time ranges from several minutes to hours depending<br/>on the technology'*'"”!-!"", The molecular detection<br/>can be affected by many factors. Although SARS-CoV-2<br/>has been detected from a variety of respiratory sources,<br/>including throat swabs, posterior oropharyngeal saliva,<br/>nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum and bronchial fluid,<br/>the viral load is higher in lower respiratory tract sam-<br/>ples'?’*!-"°, In addition, viral nucleic acid was also<br/>found in samples from the intestinal tract or blood even<br/>when respiratory samples were negative''’. Lastly, viral<br/>load may already drop from its peak level on disease<br/>onset”. Accordingly, false negatives can be common<br/>when oral swabs and used, and so multiple detection<br/>methods should be adopted to confirm a COVID-19<br/>diagnosis''”''*. Other detection methods were there-<br/>fore used to overcome this problem. Chest CT was<br/>used to quickly identify a patient when the capacity of<br/>molecular detection was overloaded in Wuhan.
