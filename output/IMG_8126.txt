handling of bats for trading purposes poses a<br/>considerable risk of transmitting zoonotic CoV<br/>epidemics (139).<br/><br/>Due to the possible role played by farm and wild<br/>animals in SARS-CoV-2 infection, the WHO, in<br/>their novel coronavirus (COVID-19) situation report,<br/>recommended the avoidance of unprotected contact<br/>with both farm and wild animals (25). The live-<br/>animal markets, like the one in Guangdong, China,<br/>provides a setting for animal coronaviruses to<br/>amplify and to be transmitted to new hosts, like<br/>humans (78). Such markets can be considered a<br/>critical place for the origin of novel zoonotic<br/>diseases and have enormous public health<br/>significance in the event of an outbreak. Bats are the<br/>reservoirs for several viruses; hence, the role of bats<br/>in the present outbreak cannot be ruled out (140). In<br/>a qualitative study conducted for evaluating the<br/>zoonotic risk factors among rural communities of<br/>southern China, the frequent human-animal<br/>interactions along with the low levels of<br/>environmental biosecurity were identified as<br/>significant risks for the emergence of zoonotic<br/>disease in local communities (141, 142).<br/><br/>The comprehensive sequence analysis of the
