DIAGNOSIS OF SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-
19)

RNA tests can confirm the diagnosis of SARS-
CoV-2 (COVID-19) cases with real-time RT-PCR or
next-generation sequencing (148, 149, 245, 246). At
present, nucleic acid detection techniques, like RT-
PCR, are considered an effective method for
confirming the diagnosis in clinical cases of COVID-
19 (148). Several companies across the world are
currently focusing on developing and marketing
SARS-CoV-2-specific nucleic acid detection kits.
Multiple laboratories are also developing their own
in-house RT-PCR. One of them is the SARS-CoV-2
nucleic acid detection kit produced by Shuoshi
Biotechnology (double fluorescence PCR method)
(150). Up to 30 March 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) had granted 22 in vitro
diagnostics Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs),
including for the RT-PCR diagnostic panel for the
universal detection of SARS-like betacoronaviruses
and specific detection of SARS-CoV-2, developed
by the U.S. CDC (Table 1) (258, 259).
