19)<br/><br/>RNA tests can confirm the diagnosis of SARS-<br/>CoV-2 (COVID-19) cases with real-time RT-PCR or<br/>next-generation sequencing (148, 149, 245, 246). At<br/>present, nucleic acid detection techniques, like RT-<br/>PCR, are considered an effective method for<br/>confirming the diagnosis in clinical cases of COVID-<br/>19 (148). Several companies across the world are<br/>currently focusing on developing and marketing<br/>SARS-CoV-2-specific nucleic acid detection kits.<br/>Multiple laboratories are also developing their own<br/>in-house RT-PCR. One of them is the SARS-CoV-2<br/>nucleic acid detection kit produced by Shuoshi<br/>Biotechnology (double fluorescence PCR method)<br/>(150). Up to 30 March 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug<br/>Administration (FDA) had granted 22 in vitro<br/>diagnostics Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs),<br/>including for the RT-PCR diagnostic panel for the<br/>universal detection of SARS-like betacoronaviruses<br/>and specific detection of SARS-CoV-2, developed<br/>by the U.S. CDC (Table 1) (258, 259).
