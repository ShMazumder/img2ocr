This is impressively<br/>fast compared to the time taken to identify SARS-<br/>CoV reported in Foshan, Guangdong Province,<br/>China (125days) (68). Immediately after the<br/>confirmation of viral etiology, the Chinese<br/>virologists rapidly released the genomic sequence of<br/>SARS-CoV-2, which played a crucial role in<br/>controlling the spread of this newly emerged novel<br/>coronavirus to other parts of the world (69).
