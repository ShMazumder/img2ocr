bilateral ground-glass opacities and will further<br/>progress to or coexist with lung consolidation<br/>changes within | to 3 weeks (159). The role played<br/>by radiologists in the current scenario is very<br/>important. Radiologists can help in the early<br/>diagnosis of lung abnormalities associated with<br/>COVID-19 pneumonia. They can also help in the<br/>evaluation of disease severity, identifying its<br/>progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome<br/>and the presence of secondary bacterial infections<br/>(160). Even though chest CT is considered an<br/>essential diagnostic tool for COVID-19, the<br/>extensive use of CT for screening purposes in the<br/>suspected individuals might be associated with a<br/>disproportionate risk-benefit ratio due to increased<br/>radiation exposure as well as increased risk of cross-<br/>infection. Hence, the use of CT for early diagnosis of<br/>SARS-CoV-2 infection in high-risk groups should be<br/>done with great caution (292).<br/><br/>More recently, other advanced diagnostics have<br/>been designed and developed for the detection of<br/>SARS-CoV-2 (345, 347, 350-352). A reverse<br/>transcriptional loop-mediated isothermal<br/>amplification (RT-LAMP), namely, iLACO, has been<br/>developed for rapid and colorimetric detection of this
