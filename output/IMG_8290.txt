immunity defences against virus invasion. Interferons<br/>induce the expression of diverse interferon-stimulated<br/>genes, which can interfere with every step of virus<br/>replication. Previous studies identified type I interfer-<br/>ons as a promising therapeutic candidate for SARS”.<br/>In vitro data showed SARS-CoV-2 is even more sen-<br/>sitive to type I interferons than SARS-CoV, suggesting<br/>the potential effectiveness of type I interferons in the<br/>early treatment of COVID-19 (REF). In China, vapor<br/>inhalation of interferon-a is included in the COVID-19<br/>treatment guideline”. Clinical trials are ongoing across<br/>the world to evaluate the efficacy of different therapies<br/>involving interferons, either alone or in combination<br/>with other agents”.<br/><br/>Immunoglobulin therapy. Convalescent plasma treat-<br/>ment is another potential adjunctive therapy for<br/>COVID-19. Preliminary findings have suggested<br/>improved clinical status after the treatment’*'™. The<br/>FDA has provided guidance for the use of COVID-19<br/>convalescent plasma under an emergency investigational<br/>new drug application. However, this treatment may have<br/>adverse effects by causing antibody-mediated enhance-<br/>ment of infection, transfusion-associated acute lung<br/>injury and allergic transfusion reactions.<br/><br/>Monoclonal antibody therapy is an effective immuno-<br/>therapy for the treatment of some viral infections in<br/>select patients. Recent studies reported specific mon-<br/>oclonal antibodies neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 infection
