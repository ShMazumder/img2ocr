The interferon response is one of the major innate
immunity defences against virus invasion. Interferons
induce the expression of diverse interferon-stimulated
genes, which can interfere with every step of virus
replication. Previous studies identified type I interfer-
ons as a promising therapeutic candidate for SARS”.
In vitro data showed SARS-CoV-2 is even more sen-
sitive to type I interferons than SARS-CoV, suggesting
the potential effectiveness of type I interferons in the
early treatment of COVID-19 (REF). In China, vapor
inhalation of interferon-a is included in the COVID-19
treatment guideline”. Clinical trials are ongoing across
the world to evaluate the efficacy of different therapies
involving interferons, either alone or in combination
with other agents”.

Immunoglobulin therapy. Convalescent plasma treat-
ment is another potential adjunctive therapy for
COVID-19. Preliminary findings have suggested
improved clinical status after the treatment’*'™. The
FDA has provided guidance for the use of COVID-19
convalescent plasma under an emergency investigational
new drug application. However, this treatment may have
adverse effects by causing antibody-mediated enhance-
ment of infection, transfusion-associated acute lung
injury and allergic transfusion reactions.

Monoclonal antibody therapy is an effective immuno-
therapy for the treatment of some viral infections in
select patients. Recent studies reported specific mon-
oclonal antibodies neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 infection
