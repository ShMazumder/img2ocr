sensitive diagnostic method that does not require<br/>sophisticated equipment or skilled personnel (349).<br/>An interactive web-based dashboard for tracking<br/>SARS-CoV-2 in a real-time mode has been designed<br/>(238). A smartphone-integrated home-based point-<br/>of-care testing (POCT) tool, a paper-based POCT<br/>combined with LAMP, is a useful point-of-care<br/>diagnostic (353). An Abbott ID Now COVID-19<br/>molecular POCT-based test, using isothermal nucleic<br/>acid amplification technology, has been designed as<br/>a point-of-care test for very rapid detection of<br/>SARS-CoV-2 in just 5 min (344). A CRISPR-based<br/>SHERLOCK (specific high-sensitivity enzymatic<br/>reporter unlocking) diagnostic for rapid detection of<br/>SARS-CoV-2 without the requirement of specialized<br/>instrumentation has been reported to be very useful<br/>in the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 (360). A<br/>CRISPR-Cas12-based lateral flow assay also has<br/>been developed for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2<br/>(346). Artificial intelligence, by means of a three-<br/>dimensional deep-learning model, has _ been<br/>developed for sensitive and specific diagnosis of<br/>COVID-19 via CT images (332).<br/><br/>Tracking and mapping of the rising incidence<br/>rates, disease outbreaks, community _ spread,
