like face masks, to break the transmission cycle of<br/>the virus; both hand hygiene and face masks help to<br/>lessen the risk of COVID-19 transmission (315).<br/><br/>Medical staff are in the group of individuals most<br/>at risk of getting COVID-19 infection. This is<br/>because they are exposed directly to infected<br/>patients. Hence, proper training must be given to all<br/>hospital staff on methods of prevention and<br/>protection so that they become competent enough to<br/>protect themselves and others from this deadly<br/>disease (316). As a preventive measure, health care<br/>workers caring for infected patients should take<br/>extreme precautions against both contact and<br/>airborne transmission. They should use PPE such as<br/>face masks (N95 or FFP3), eye protection (goggles),<br/>gowns, and gloves to nullify the risk of infection<br/>(299).<br/><br/>The human-to-human transmission reported in<br/>SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs mainly through<br/>droplet or direct contact. Due to this finding,<br/>frontline health care workers should follow stringent<br/>infection control and preventive measures, such as<br/>the use of PPE, to prevent infection (110).
