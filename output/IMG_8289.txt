coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-like CoVs,<br/>the comparative analysis recognized a furin-like<br/>cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein that is<br/>missing from other SARS-like CoVs (99). The furin-<br/>like cleavage site is expected to play a role in the life<br/>cycle of the virus and disease pathogenicity and<br/>might even act as a therapeutic target for furin<br/>inhibitors. The highly contagious nature of SARS-<br/>CoV-2 compared to that of its predecessors might be<br/>the result of a stabilizing mutation that occurred in<br/>the endosome-associated-protein-like domain of<br/>nsp2 protein.<br/><br/>Similarly, the destabilizing mutation near the<br/>phosphatase domain of nsp3 proteins in SARS-CoV-<br/>2 could indicate a potential mechanism that<br/>differentiates it from other CoVs (100). Even though<br/>the CFR reported for COVID-19 is meager<br/>compared to those of the previous SARS and MERS<br/>outbreaks, it has caused more deaths than SARS and<br/>MERS combined (101). Possibly related to the viral<br/>pathogenesis is the recent finding of an 832-<br/>nucleotide (nt) deletion in ORF8, which appears to<br/>reduce the replicative fitness of the virus and leads to<br/>attenuated phenotypes of SARS-CoV-2 (256).<br/><br/>Coronavirus is the most prominent example of a
