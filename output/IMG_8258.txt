alone or in combination with other effective<br/>neutralizing antibodies for the treatment and<br/>prevention of COVID-19 (202). Furthermore, SARS-<br/>CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, like m396 and<br/>CR3014, failed to bind the S protein of SARS-CoV-<br/>2, indicating that a particular level of similarity is<br/>mandatory between the RBDs of SARS-CoV and<br/>SARS-CoV-2 for the cross-reactivity to occur.<br/><br/>Further assessment is necessary before<br/>confirming the effectiveness of such combination<br/>therapy. In addition, to prevent further community<br/>and nosocomial spread of COVID-19, the<br/>postprocedure risk management program should not<br/>be neglected (309). Development of broad-spectrum<br/>inhibitors against the human coronaviral pathogens<br/>will help to facilitate clinical trials on the<br/>effectiveness of such inhibitors against endemic and<br/>emerging coronaviruses (203). A promising animal<br/>study revealed the protective effect of passive<br/>immunotherapy with immune serum from MERS-<br/>immune camels on mice infected with MERS-CoV<br/>(204). Passive immunotherapy using convalescent<br/>plasma is another strategy that can be used for<br/>treating COVID-19-infected, critically ill patients<br/>(205).
