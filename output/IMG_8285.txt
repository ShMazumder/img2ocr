injury associated with human-machine incoordination (122). The result obtained from a clinical study of four patients infected with COVID- 19 claimed that combination therapy using lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, and Shufeng Jiedu capsules (traditional Chinese medicine) was found to be effective in managing COVID-19 pneumonia (193). It is difficult to evaluate the therapeutic potential of a drug or a combination of drugs for managing a disease based on such a limited sample size. Before choosing the ideal therapeutic agent for the management of COVID-19, randomized clinical control studies should be performed with a sufficient study population.<br/>Antiviral Drugs<br/>Several classes of routinely used antiviral drugs, like oseltamivir (neuraminidase inhibitor), acyclovir, ganciclovir, and ribavirin, do not have any effect on COVID-19 and, hence, are not recommended (187). Oseltamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor, has been explored in Chinese hospitals for treating suspected COVID-19 cases, although proven efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 is still lacking for this drug (7). The in vitro antiviral potential of FAD-approved drugs, viz.,
