injury associated with human-machine<br/>incoordination (122). The result obtained from a<br/>clinical study of four patients infected with COVID-<br/>19 claimed that combination therapy using<br/>lopinavir/ritonavir, arbidol, and Shufeng Jiedu<br/>capsules (traditional Chinese medicine) was found to<br/>be effective in managing COVID-19 pneumonia<br/>(193). It is difficult to evaluate the therapeutic<br/>potential of a drug or a combination of drugs for<br/>managing a disease based on such a limited sample<br/>size. Before choosing the ideal therapeutic agent for<br/>the management of COVID-19, randomized clinical<br/>control studies should be performed with a sufficient<br/>study population.<br/><br/>Antiviral Drugs<br/><br/>Several classes of routinely used antiviral drugs,<br/>like oseltamivir (neuraminidase inhibitor), acyclovir,<br/>ganciclovir, and ribavirin, do not have any effect on<br/>COVID-19 and, hence, are not recommended (187).<br/>Oseltamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor, has been<br/>explored in Chinese hospitals for treating suspected<br/>COVID-19 cases, although proven efficacy against<br/>SARS-CoV-2 is still lacking for this drug (7). The in<br/>vitro antiviral potential of FAD-approved drugs, viz.,
