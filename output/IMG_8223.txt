1-en-3-ylamino)-5-[2-(4- iodophenyl)hydrazinyl]-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiol and 4-(cyclopent- 1-en-3-ylamino)-5-[2-(4- chlorophenyl)hydrazinyl]-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiol were found to be the most potent. These compounds were used for in silico studies, and molecular docking was accomplished into the active binding site of MERS-CoV helicase nsp13 (21). Further studies are required for evaluating the therapeutic potential of these newly identified compounds in the management of COVID-19 infection.<br/>Passive Immunization/Antibody Therapy/MAb<br/>Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) may be helpful in the intervention of disease in CoV-exposed individuals. Patients recovering from SARS showed robust neutralizing antibodies against this CoV infection (164). A set of MAbs aimed at the MERS- CoV S protein-specific domains, comprising six specific epitope groups interacting with receptor- binding, membrane fusion, and sialic acid-binding sites, make up crucial entry tasks of S protein (198, 199). Passive immunization employing weaker and strongly neutralizing antibodies provided considerable protection in mice against a MERS-
