1-en-3-ylamino)-5-[2-(4-<br/>iodophenyl)hydrazinyl]-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiol and<br/>4-(cyclopent- 1-en-3-ylamino)-5-[2-(4-<br/>chlorophenyl)hydrazinyl]-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiol<br/>were found to be the most potent. These compounds<br/>were used for in silico studies, and molecular<br/>docking was accomplished into the active binding<br/>site of MERS-CoV helicase nsp13 (21). Further<br/>studies are required for evaluating the therapeutic<br/>potential of these newly identified compounds in the<br/>management of COVID-19 infection.<br/><br/>Passive Immunization/Antibody Therapy/MAb<br/><br/>Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) may be helpful in<br/>the intervention of disease in CoV-exposed<br/>individuals. Patients recovering from SARS showed<br/>robust neutralizing antibodies against this CoV<br/>infection (164). A set of MAbs aimed at the MERS-<br/>CoV S protein-specific domains, comprising six<br/>specific epitope groups interacting with receptor-<br/>binding, membrane fusion, and sialic acid-binding<br/>sites, make up crucial entry tasks of S protein (198,<br/>199). Passive immunization employing weaker and<br/>strongly neutralizing antibodies provided<br/>considerable protection in mice against a MERS-
