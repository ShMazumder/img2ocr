<br/>Prevention [21, 30]<br/><br/>Since at this time there are no<br/>approved treatments for this infection,<br/>prevention is crucial. Several<br/>properties of this virus make<br/>prevention difficult namely, non-<br/>specific features of the disease, the<br/>infectivity even before onset of<br/>symptoms in the incubation period,<br/>transmission from asymptomatic<br/>people, long incubation period, tropism<br/>for mucosal surfaces such as the<br/>conjunctiva, prolonged duration of the<br/>illness and transmission even after<br/><br/>clinical recovery.<br/><br/>Isolation of confirmed or suspected<br/>cases with mild illness at home is<br/>recommended. The ventilation at home<br/>should be good with sunlight to allow<br/>for destruction of virus. Patients should<br/>be asked to wear a simple surgical<br/><br/>mask and practice cough hygiene.
