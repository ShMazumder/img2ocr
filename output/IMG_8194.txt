management of COVID-19 would be difficult for<br/>low-income countries due to their inability to<br/>respond rapidly due to the lack of an efficient health<br/>care system (65). Controlling the imported cases is<br/>critical in preventing the spread of COVID-19 to<br/>other countries that have not reported the disease<br/>until now. The possibility of an imported case of<br/>COVID-19 leading to sustained human-to-human<br/>transmission was estimated to be 0.41. This can be<br/>reduced to a value of 0.012 by decreasing the mean<br/>time from the onset of symptoms to hospitalization<br/>and can only be made possible by using intense<br/>disease surveillance systems (235). The silent<br/>importations of infected individuals (before the<br/>manifestation of clinical signs) also contributed<br/>significantly to the spread of disease across the<br/>major cities of the world. Even though the travel ban<br/>was implemented in Wuhan (89), infected persons<br/>who traveled out of the city just before the<br/>imposition of the ban might have remained<br/>undetected and resulted in local outbreaks (236).<br/>Emerging novel diseases like COVID-19 are difficult<br/>to contain within the country of origin, since<br/>globalization has led to a world without borders.<br/>Hence, international collaboration plays a vital role
