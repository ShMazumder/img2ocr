infection, limiting its use to the earlier stages of<br/>infection. Several laboratories around the world are<br/>currently developing antibody-based diagnostic tests<br/>against SARS-CoV-2 (157).<br/><br/>Chest CT is an ideal diagnostic tool for<br/>identifying viral pneumonia. The sensitivity of chest<br/>CT is far superior to that of X-ray screening. The<br/>chest CT findings associated with COVID-19-<br/>infected patients include characteristic patchy<br/>infiltration that later progresses to ground-glass<br/>opacities (158). Early manifestations of COVID-19<br/>pneumonia might not be evident in X-ray chest<br/>radiography. In such situations, a chest CT<br/>examination can be performed, as it is considered<br/>highly specific for COVID-19 pneumonia (118).<br/>Those patients having COVID-19 pneumonia will<br/>exhibit the typical ground-glass opacity in their chest<br/>CT images (154). The patients infected with<br/>COVID-19 had elevated plasma angiotensin 2 levels.<br/>The level of angiotensin 2 was found to be linearly<br/>associated with viral load and lung injury, indicating<br/>its potential as a diagnostic biomarker (121). The<br/>chest CT imaging abnormalities associated with<br/>COVID-19 pneumonia have also been observed even<br/>in asymptomatic patients. These abnormalities
