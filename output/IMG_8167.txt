residues for receptor binding” (FIG. 3b). In comparison
with the Guangdong strains, pangolin coronaviruses
reported from Guangxi are less similar to SARS-CoV-2,
with 85.5% genome sequence identity”. The repeated
occurrence of SARS-CoV-2-related coronavirus infec-
tions in pangolins from different smuggling events
suggests that these animals are possible hosts of the
viruses. However, unlike bats, which carry coronaviruses
healthily, the infected pangolins showed clinical signs
and histopathological changes, including interstitial
pneumonia and inflammatory cell infiltration in diverse
organs*’. These abnormalities suggest that pangolins are
unlikely to be the reservoir of these coronaviruses but
more likely acquired the viruses after spillover from the
natural hosts.

An intermediate host usually plays an important role
in the outbreak of bat-derived emerging coronaviruses;
for example, palm civets for SARS-CoV and dromedary
camels for MERS-CoV. The virus strains carried by these
two intermediate hosts were almost genetically identi-
cal to the corresponding viruses in humans (more than
99% genome sequence identity)'. Despise an RBD that is
virtually identical to that of SARS-CoV-2, the pangolin
coronaviruses known to date have no more than 92%
genome identity with SARS-CoV-2 (REF). The avail-
able data are insufficient to interpret pangolins as the
intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2. So far, no evidence
has shown that pangolins were directly involved in the
emergence of SARS-CoV-2.
