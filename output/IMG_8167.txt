with the Guangdong strains, pangolin coronaviruses<br/>reported from Guangxi are less similar to SARS-CoV-2,<br/>with 85.5% genome sequence identity”. The repeated<br/>occurrence of SARS-CoV-2-related coronavirus infec-<br/>tions in pangolins from different smuggling events<br/>suggests that these animals are possible hosts of the<br/>viruses. However, unlike bats, which carry coronaviruses<br/>healthily, the infected pangolins showed clinical signs<br/>and histopathological changes, including interstitial<br/>pneumonia and inflammatory cell infiltration in diverse<br/>organs*’. These abnormalities suggest that pangolins are<br/>unlikely to be the reservoir of these coronaviruses but<br/>more likely acquired the viruses after spillover from the<br/>natural hosts.<br/><br/>An intermediate host usually plays an important role<br/>in the outbreak of bat-derived emerging coronaviruses;<br/>for example, palm civets for SARS-CoV and dromedary<br/>camels for MERS-CoV. The virus strains carried by these<br/>two intermediate hosts were almost genetically identi-<br/>cal to the corresponding viruses in humans (more than<br/>99% genome sequence identity)'. Despise an RBD that is<br/>virtually identical to that of SARS-CoV-2, the pangolin<br/>coronaviruses known to date have no more than 92%<br/>genome identity with SARS-CoV-2 (REF). The avail-<br/>able data are insufficient to interpret pangolins as the<br/>intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2. So far, no evidence<br/>has shown that pangolins were directly involved in the<br/>emergence of SARS-CoV-2.
