infect several domestic and wild ruminants (126).<br/>BoCoV inflicts neonatal calf diarrhea in adult cattle,<br/>leading to bloody diarrhea (winter dysentery) and<br/>respiratory disease complex (shipping fever) in cattle<br/>of all age groups (126). BoCoV-like viruses have<br/>been noted in humans, suggesting its zoonotic<br/>potential as well (127). Feline enteric and feline<br/>infectious peritonitis (FIP) viruses are the two major<br/>feline CoVs (128), where feline CoVs can affect the<br/>gastrointestinal tract, abdominal cavity (peritonitis),<br/>respiratory tract, and central nervous system (128).<br/>Canines are also affected by CoVs that fall under<br/>different genera, namely, canine enteric coronavirus<br/>in Alphacoronavirus and canine _ respiratory<br/>coronavirus in Betacoronavirus, affecting the enteric<br/>and respiratory tract, respectively (129, 130). IBV,<br/>under Gammacoronavirus, causes diseases of<br/>respiratory, urinary, and reproductive systems, with<br/>substantial economic losses in chickens (131, 132).<br/>In small laboratory animals, mouse hepatitis virus,<br/>rat sialodacryoadenitis coronavirus, and guinea pig<br/>and rabbit coronaviruses are the major CoVs<br/>associated with disease manifestations like enteritis,<br/>hepatitis, and respiratory infections (10, 133).<br/><br/>Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus
