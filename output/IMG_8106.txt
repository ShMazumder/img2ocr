SARS-CoV and SARS-like (SL) CoVs to evaluate<br/>the possibility of repurposed vaccines against<br/>COVID-19. This strategy will be helpful in the<br/>scenario of an outbreak, since much time can be<br/>saved, because preliminary evaluation, including in<br/>vitro studies, already would be completed for such<br/>vaccine candidates.<br/><br/>Multiepitope subunit vaccines can be considered<br/>a promising preventive strategy against the ongoing<br/>COVID-19 pandemic. In silico and advanced<br/>immunoinformatic tools can be used to develop<br/>multiepitope subunit vaccines. The vaccines that are<br/>engineered by this technique can be further evaluated<br/>using docking studies and, if found effective, then<br/>can be further evaluated in animal models (365).<br/>Identifying epitopes that have the potential to<br/>become a vaccine candidate is critical to developing<br/>an effective vaccine against COVID-19. The<br/>immunoinformatics approach has been used for<br/>recognizing essential epitopes of cytotoxic T<br/>lymphocytes and B_ cells from the surface<br/>glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Recently, a few<br/>epitopes have been recognized from the SARS-CoV-<br/>2 surface glycoprotein. The selected epitopes<br/>explored targeting molecular dynamic simulations,
