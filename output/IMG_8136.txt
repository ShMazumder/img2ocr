human transmission is warranted.<br/><br/>M Protein<br/><br/>The M protein is the most abundant viral protein<br/>present in the virion particle, giving a definite shape<br/>to the viral envelope (48). It binds to the<br/>nucleocapsid and acts as a central organizer of<br/>coronavirus assembly (49). Coronavirus M proteins<br/>are highly diverse in amino acid contents but<br/>maintain overall structural similarity within different<br/>genera (50). The M protein has three transmembrane<br/>domains, flanked by a short amino terminus outside<br/>the virion and a long carboxy terminus inside the<br/>virion (50). Overall, the viral scaffold is maintained<br/>by M-M interaction. Of note, the M protein of<br/>SARS-CoV-2 does not have an amino acid<br/>substitution compared to that of SARS-CoV (16).<br/><br/>E Protein<br/><br/>The coronavirus E protein is the most enigmatic<br/>and smallest of the major structural proteins (51). It<br/>plays a multifunctional role in the pathogenesis,<br/>assembly, and release of the virus (52). It is a small<br/>integral membrane polypeptide that acts as a<br/>viroporin (ion channel) (53).
