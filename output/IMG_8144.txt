<br/>with this infection (24).<br/><br/>SARS is a viral respiratory disease caused by a<br/>formerly unrecognized animal CoV that originated<br/>from the wet markets in southern China after<br/>adapting to the human host, thereby enabling<br/>transmission between humans (90). The SARS<br/>outbreak reported in 2002 to 2003 had 8,098<br/>confirmed cases with 774 total deaths (9.6%) (93).<br/>The outbreak severely affected the Asia Pacific<br/>region, especially mainland China (94). Even though<br/>the case fatality rate (CFR) of SARS-CoV-2<br/>(COVID-19) is lower than that of SARS-CoV, there<br/>exists a severe concern linked to this outbreak due to<br/>its epidemiological similarity to influenza viruses<br/>(95, 279). This can fail the public health system,<br/>resulting in a pandemic (96).<br/><br/>MERS is another respiratory disease that was<br/>first reported in Saudi Arabia during the year 2012.<br/>The disease was found to have a CFR of around 35%<br/>(97). The analysis of available data sets suggests that<br/>the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV,<br/>and MERS-CoV is in almost the same range. The<br/>longest predicted incubation time of SARS-CoV-2 is<br/>14 days. Hence, suspected individuals are isolated<br/>for 14 days to avoid the risk of further spread (98).<br/>Even though a high similarity has been reported
