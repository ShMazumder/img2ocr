histocompatibility complex class I molecules. They<br/>potentially induce immune responses (176). The<br/>recombinant vaccine can be designed by using rabies<br/>virus (RV) as a viral vector. RV can be made to<br/>express MERS-CoV S1 protein on its surface so that<br/>an immune response is induced against MERS-CoV.<br/>The RV vector-based vaccines against MERS-CoV<br/>can induce faster antibody response as well as higher<br/>degrees of cellular immunity than the Gram-positive<br/>enhancer matrix (GEM) particle vector-based<br/>vaccine. However, the latter can induce a very high<br/>antibody response at lower doses (167). Hence, the<br/>degree of humoral and cellular immune responses<br/>produced by such vaccines depends upon the vector<br/>used.<br/><br/>Dual vaccines have been getting more popular<br/>recently. Among them, the rabies virus-based<br/>vectored vaccine platform is used to develop<br/>vaccines against emerging infectious diseases. The<br/>dual vaccine developed from inactivated rabies virus<br/>particles that express the MERS-CoV S1 domain of<br/>S protein was found to induce immune responses for<br/>both MERS-CoV and rabies virus. The vaccinated<br/>mice were found to be completely protected from<br/>challenge with MERS-CoV (169). The intranasal
