<br/>COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by<br/>SARS-CoV-2, which is also termed the novel<br/>coronavirus and is diligently associated with the<br/>SARS virus. The Ministry of Science and<br/>Technology from the People’s Republic of China<br/>declared three potential antiviral medicines<br/>suitable for treating COVID-19. Those three<br/>medicines are, namely, Favilavir, chloroquine<br/>phosphate and remdesivir. A clinical trial was<br/>conducted to test the efficacy of those three<br/>drugs, and the results proved that out of the<br/>three medicines above only Favilavir is effective<br/>in treating the patients with novel coronavirus.<br/>The remaining two drugs were effective in<br/>treating malaria.°7<br/><br/>Likewise a study carried out in the United States<br/>by the National Institute of Health proved that<br/>remdesivir is effective in treating the Middle<br/>East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-<br/>CoV), which is also a type of coronavirus that<br/>was transmitted from monkeys. The drug<br/>remdesivir was also used in the United States<br/>for treating the patients with COVID-19. There<br/>has been a proposal to use the combination of<br/>protease inhibitors lopinavir-ritonavir for<br/>treating the patients affected by COVID-19.°%
