further studies (332). Rather than waiting for firmer<br/>evidence on animal-to-human transmission,<br/>necessary preventive measures are advised, as well<br/>as following social distancing practices among<br/>companion animals of different households (331).<br/>One of the leading veterinary diagnostic companies,<br/>IDEXX, has conducted large-scale testing for<br/>COVID-19 in specimens collected from dogs and<br/>cats. However, none of the tests turned out to be<br/>positive (334).<br/><br/>In a study conducted to investigate the potential<br/>of different animal species to act as the intermediate<br/>host of SARS-CoV-2, it was found that both ferrets<br/>and cats can be infected via experimental inoculation<br/>of the virus. In addition, infected cats efficiently<br/>transmitted the disease to naive cats (329). SARS-<br/>CoV-2 infection and subsequent transmission in<br/>ferrets were found to recapitulate the clinical aspects<br/>of COVID-19 in humans. The infected ferrets also<br/>shed virus via multiple routes, such as saliva, nasal<br/>washes, feces, and urine, postinfection, making them<br/>an ideal animal model for studying disease<br/>transmission (337). Experimental inoculation was<br/>also done in other animal species and found that the<br/>dogs have low susceptibility, while the chickens,
