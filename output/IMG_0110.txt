Thus, immunomodulatory agents<br/>that inhibit the excessive inflammatory response may<br/>be a potential adjunctive therapy for COVID-19.<br/>Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid often used in a wide<br/>range of conditions to relieve inflammation through<br/>its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects.<br/>Recently, the RECOVERY trial found dexamethasone<br/>reduced mortality by about one third in hospitalized<br/>patients with COVID-19 who received invasive mechan-<br/>ical ventilation and by one fifth in patients receiving<br/>oxygen. By contrast, no benefit was found in patients<br/>without respiratory support'”’.<br/><br/>Tocilizumab and sarilumab, two types of interleukin-6<br/>(IL-6) receptor-specific antibodies previously used to<br/>reat various types of arthritis, including rheumatoid<br/>arthritis, and cytokine release syndrome, showed effec-<br/>iveness in the treatment of severe COVID- 19 by atten-<br/>uating the cytokine storm in a small uncontrolled trial”.<br/>Bevacizumab is an anti-vascular endothelial growth<br/>‘actor (VEGF) medication that could potentially reduce<br/>pulmonary oedema in patients with severe COVID-19.<br/>Eculizumab is a specific monoclonal antibody that<br/>inhibits the proinflammatory complement protein C5.<br/>Preliminary results showed that it induced a drop of<br/>inflammatory markers and C-reactive protein levels,<br/>suggesting its potential to be an option for the treatment<br/>of severe COVID-19 (REF.'“’).
