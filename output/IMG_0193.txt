SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 on pregnancy. Researchers<br/>have mentioned the probability of in utero<br/>transmission of novel SARS-CoV-2 from COVID-<br/>19-infected mothers to their neonates in China based<br/>upon the rise in IgM and IgG antibody levels and<br/>cytokine values in the blood obtained from newborn<br/>infants immediately postbirth; however, RI-PCR<br/>failed to confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2<br/>genetic material in the infants (283). Recent studies<br/>show that at least in some cases, preterm delivery<br/>and its consequences are associated with the virus.<br/>Nonetheless, some cases have raised doubts for the<br/>likelihood of vertical transmission (240â€”243).<br/>COVID-19 infection was associated with<br/>pneumonia, and some developed acute respiratory<br/>distress syndrome (ARDS). The blood biochemistry<br/>indexes, such as albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, C-<br/>reactive protein, lymphocytes (percent), and<br/>neutrophils (percent) give an idea about the disease<br/>severity in COVID-19 infection (121). During<br/>COVID-19, patients may present leukocytosis,<br/>leukopenia with lymphopenia (244),<br/>hypoalbuminemia, and an increase of lactate<br/>dehydrogenase, aspartate transaminase, alanine<br/>aminotransferase, bilirubin, and, especially, D-dimer<br/><br/>SAAN WWW 1 1 41471 1 om
