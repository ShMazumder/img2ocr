on its official website, has mentioned a detailed list<br/>of COVID-19 vaccine agents that are under<br/>consideration. Different phases of trials are ongoing<br/>for live attenuated virus vaccines, formaldehyde<br/>alum inactivated vaccine, adenovirus type 5 vector<br/>vaccine, LNP-encapsulated mRNA vaccine, DNA<br/>plasmid vaccine, and S protein, S-trimer, and li-Key<br/>peptide as a subunit protein vaccine, among others<br/>(298). The process of vaccine development usually<br/>takes approximately ten years, in the case of<br/>inactivated or live attenuated vaccines, since it<br/>involves the generation of long-term efficacy data.<br/>However, this was brought down to 5 years during<br/>the Ebola emergency for viral vector vaccines. In the<br/>urgency associated with the COVID-19 outbreaks,<br/>we expect a vaccine by the end of this year (343).<br/>The development of an effective vaccine against<br/>COVID-19 with high speed and precision is the<br/>combined result of advancements in computational<br/>biology, gene synthesis, protein engineering, and the<br/>invention of advanced manufacturing platforms<br/>(342).<br/><br/>The recurring nature of the coronavirus outbreaks<br/>calls for the development of a pan-coronavirus<br/>vaccine that can produce cross-reactive antibodies.
