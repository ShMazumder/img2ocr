arranged in helical symmetry, which reflects an atypical attribute in positive-sense RNA viruses (30). The electron micrographs of SARS-CoV-2 revealed a diverging spherical outline with some degree of pleomorphism, virion diameters varying from 60 to 140 nm, and distinct spikes of 9 to 12 nm, giving the virus the appearance of a solar corona (3). The CoV genome is arranged linearly as 5â€™-leader-UTR- replicase-structural genes (S-E-M-N)-3' UTR- poly(A) (32). Accessory genes, such as 3a/b, 4a/b, and the hemagglutinin-esterase gene (HE), are also seen intermingled with the structural genes (30). SARS-CoV-2 has also been found to be arranged similarly and encodes several accessory proteins, although it lacks the HE, which is characteristic of some betacoronaviruses (31). The positive-sense genome of CoVs serves as the mRNA and is translated to polyprotein la/lab (ppla/lab) (33). A replication-transcription complex (RTC) is formed in double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) by nonstructural proteins (nsps), encoded by the polyprotein gene (34). Subsequently, the RTC synthesizes a nested set of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) via discontinuous transcription (35).
