arranged in helical symmetry, which reflects an<br/>atypical attribute in positive-sense RNA viruses (30).<br/>The electron micrographs of SARS-CoV-2 revealed<br/>a diverging spherical outline with some degree of<br/>pleomorphism, virion diameters varying from 60 to<br/>140 nm, and distinct spikes of 9 to 12 nm, giving the<br/>virus the appearance of a solar corona (3). The CoV<br/>genome is arranged linearly as 5â€™-leader-UTR-<br/>replicase-structural genes (S-E-M-N)-3' UTR-<br/>poly(A) (32). Accessory genes, such as 3a/b, 4a/b,<br/>and the hemagglutinin-esterase gene (HE), are also<br/>seen intermingled with the structural genes (30).<br/>SARS-CoV-2 has also been found to be arranged<br/>similarly and encodes several accessory proteins,<br/>although it lacks the HE, which is characteristic of<br/>some betacoronaviruses (31). The positive-sense<br/>genome of CoVs serves as the mRNA and is<br/>translated to polyprotein la/lab (ppla/lab) (33). A<br/>replication-transcription complex (RTC) is formed in<br/>double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) by nonstructural<br/>proteins (nsps), encoded by the polyprotein gene<br/>(34). Subsequently, the RTC synthesizes a nested set<br/>of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) via discontinuous<br/>transcription (35).
