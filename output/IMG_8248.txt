due to the lack of diagnostic assay kits. This will<br/>further result in the extensive transmission of<br/>COVID-19, since only a portion of suspected cases<br/>can be diagnosed. In such situations, conventional<br/>serological assays, like enzyme-linked<br/>immunosorbent assay (ELISA), that are specific to<br/>COVID-19 IgM and IgG antibodies can be used as a<br/>high-throughput alternative (149). At present, there<br/>is no diagnostic kit available for detecting the SARS-<br/>CoV-2 antibody (150). The specific antibody profiles<br/>of COVID-19 patients were analyzed, and it was<br/>found that the IgM level lasted more than 1 month,<br/>indicating a prolonged stage of virus replication in<br/>SARS-CoV-2-infected patients. The IgG levels were<br/>found to increase only in the later stages of the<br/>disease. These findings indicate that the specific<br/>antibody profiles of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV<br/>were similar (325). These findings can be utilized for<br/>the development of specific diagnostic tests against<br/>COVID-19 and can be used for rapid screening.<br/>Even though diagnostic test kits are already available<br/>that can detect the genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-<br/>2 (95), their availability is a concern, as the number<br/>of COVID-19 cases is skyrocketing (155, 157). A<br/>major problem associated with this diagnostic kit is
