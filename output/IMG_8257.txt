further adding to the complexity of disease<br/>transmission dynamics. Atypical clinical<br/>manifestations may only express symptoms such as<br/>fatigue instead of respiratory signs such as fever,<br/>cough, and sputum. In such cases, the clinician must<br/>be vigilant for the possible occurrence of<br/>asymptomatic and atypical clinical manifestations to<br/>avoid the possibility of missed diagnoses.<br/><br/>The present outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2<br/>was, indeed, expected. Similar to previous outbreaks,<br/>the current pandemic also will be contained shortly.<br/>However, the real question is, how are we planning<br/>to counter the next zoonotic CoV epidemic that is<br/>likely to occur within the next 5 to 10 years or<br/>perhaps sooner? Our knowledge of most of the bat<br/>CoVs is scarce, as these viruses have not been<br/>isolated and studied, and extensive studies on such<br/>viruses are typically only conducted when they are<br/>associated with specific disease outbreaks. The next<br/>step following the control of the COVID-19 outbreak<br/>in China should be focused on_ screening,<br/>identification, isolation, and characterization of<br/>CoVs_ present in wildlife species of China,<br/>particularly in bats. Both in vitro and in vivo studies<br/>(using suitable animal models) should be conducted
