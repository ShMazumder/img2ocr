tive cleavage by furin and other proteases”. Such an<br/>S1-S2 cleavage site is not observed in all related viruses<br/>belonging to the subgenus Sarbecovirus, except for a<br/>similar three amino acid insertion (PAA) in RmYN02,<br/>a bat-derived coronavirus newly reported from<br/>Rhinolophus malayanus in China” (FIG. 3a). Although the<br/>insertion in RmYNO02 does not functionally represent a<br/>polybasic cleavage site, it provides support for the notion<br/>that this characteristic, initially considered unique to<br/>SARS-CoV-2, has been acquired naturally’*. A structural<br/>study suggested that the furin-cleavage site can reduce<br/>the stability of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and facilitate the<br/>conformational adaption that is required for the binding<br/>of the RBD to its receptor”. Whether the higher trans-<br/>missibility of SARS-CoV-2 compared with SARS-CoV<br/>is a gain of function associated with acquisition of the<br/>furin-like cleavage site is yet to be demonstrated”®.<br/><br/>An additional distinction is the accessory gene orf8<br/>of SARS-CoV-2, which encodes a novel protein showing<br/>only 40% amino acid identity to ORF8 of SARS-CoV.<br/>Unlike in SARS-CoV, this new ORF8 protein does<br/>not contain a motif that triggers intracellular stress<br/>pathways”. Notably, a SARS-CoV-2 variant with a<br/>382-nucleotide deletion covering the whole of ORF8 has<br/>been discovered in a number of patients in Singapore,<br/>which resembles the 29- or 415-nucleotide deletions in<br/>the ORF8 region observed in human SARS-CoV variants<br/>from the late phase of the 2002-2003 outbreak”. Such<br/>ORFS deletion may be indicative of human adaptation<br/><br/>after cross-species transmission from an animal host.<br/><br/>m. ... Py, ae: fF age. yp aane
