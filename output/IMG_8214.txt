Recently, individuals<br/>with asymptomatic infection were also found to act<br/>as a source of infection to susceptible individuals<br/>(81). Both the asymptomatic and symptomatic<br/>patients secrete similar viral loads, which indicates<br/>that the transmission capacity of asymptomatic or<br/>minimally symptomatic patients is very high.
