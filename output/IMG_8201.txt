<br/>Usually replication of coronavirus occurs within<br/>the cytoplasm and is closely associated with<br/>endoplasmic reticulum and other cellular<br/>membrane organelles. Human coronaviruses<br/>are thought to invade cells, primarily through<br/>different receptors. For 229E and OC43, amino<br/>peptidase-N (AP-N) and a sialic acid containing<br/>receptor, respectively, were known to function<br/>in this role. After the virus enters the host cell<br/>and uncoating process occurs, the genome is<br/>transcribed, and then, translated. A<br/>characteristic feature of replication is that all<br/>mRNAs form an enclosed group of typical 3’<br/>ends; only the special portions of the 5’ ends<br/>are translated. In total, about 7 MRNAs are<br/>produced. The shortest mRNA codes and the<br/>others can express the synthesis of another<br/>genome segment for nucleoprotein. At the cell<br/>membrane, these proteins are collected and<br/>genomic RNA is initiated as a mature particle<br/>type by burgeoning from internal cell<br/>membranes.2* 2°<br/><br/>5 PATHOGENESIS<br/><br/>Coronaviruses are tremendously precise and<br/>mature in most of the airway epithelial cells as<br/>observed through both in vivo and in vitro
