bundle that brings the viral and cellular membranes<br/>in close proximity, facilitating its fusion. The<br/>sequence alignment study conducted between<br/>COVID-19 and SARS-CoV identified that the S2<br/>subunits are highly conserved in these CoVs. The<br/>HR1 and HR2 domains showed 92.6% and 100%<br/>overall identity, respectively (210). From these<br/>findings, we can confirm the significance of<br/>COVID-19 HR1 and HR2 and their vital role in host<br/>cell entry. Hence, fusion inhibitors target the HR1<br/>domain of S protein, thereby preventing viral fusion<br/>and entry into the host cell. This is another potential<br/>therapeutic strategy that can be used in the<br/>management of COVID-19. Other than the specific<br/>therapy directed against COVID-19, general<br/>treatments play a vital role in the enhancement of<br/>host immune responses against the viral agent.<br/>Inadequate nutrition is linked to the weakening of<br/>the host immune response, making the individual<br/>more susceptible. The role played by nutrition in<br/>disease susceptibility should be measured by<br/>evaluating the nutritional status of patients with<br/>COVID-19 (205).
