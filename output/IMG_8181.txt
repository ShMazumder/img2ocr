bundle that brings the viral and cellular membranes in close proximity, facilitating its fusion. The sequence alignment study conducted between COVID-19 and SARS-CoV identified that the S2 subunits are highly conserved in these CoVs. The HR1 and HR2 domains showed 92.6% and 100% overall identity, respectively (210). From these findings, we can confirm the significance of COVID-19 HR1 and HR2 and their vital role in host cell entry. Hence, fusion inhibitors target the HR1 domain of S protein, thereby preventing viral fusion and entry into the host cell. This is another potential therapeutic strategy that can be used in the management of COVID-19. Other than the specific therapy directed against COVID-19, general treatments play a vital role in the enhancement of host immune responses against the viral agent. Inadequate nutrition is linked to the weakening of the host immune response, making the individual more susceptible. The role played by nutrition in disease susceptibility should be measured by evaluating the nutritional status of patients with COVID-19 (205).
