this virus through human-to-human<br/>transmission, with the fact that it has become<br/>widespread around the globe. This confirms the<br/>fact similar to the previous epidemics, including<br/>SARS and MERS, that this coronavirus exhibited<br/>potential human-to-human transmission, as it<br/>was recently declared a pandemic by WHO.7°<br/><br/>Respiratory droplets are the major carrier for<br/>coronavirus transmission. Such droplets can<br/>either stay in the nose or mouth or enter the<br/>lungs via the inhaled air. Currently, it is known<br/>that COVID-19’s transmission from one person<br/>to another also occurs through touching either<br/>an infected surface or even an object. With the<br/>current scant awareness of the transmission<br/>systems however, airborne safety measures<br/>with a high-risk procedure have been proposed<br/>in many countries. Transmission levels, or the<br/>rates from one person to another, reported<br/>differ by both location and interaction with<br/>involvement in infection control. It is stated that<br/>even asymptomatic individuals or those<br/>individuals in their incubation period can act as<br/>carrier of SARS-CoV2.7” 2° With the data and<br/>evidence provided by the CDC, the usual<br/>incubation period is probably 3 to 7 days,<br/>sometimes being prolonged up to even 2<br/>weeks, and the typical symptom occurrence
