<br/>using the â€˜Megalign stoned program, siete the<br/>similarity between the novel SARS-CoV-2 isolates<br/>was in the range of 99.4% to 100%. Among the other<br/>Serbecovirus CoV sequences, the novel SARS-CoV-<br/>2 sequences revealed the highest similarity to bat-<br/>SL-CoV, with nucleotide percent identity ranges<br/>between 88.12 and 89.65%. Meanwhile, earlier<br/>reported SARS-CoVs showed 70.6 to 74.9%<br/>similarity to SARS-CoV-2 at the nucleotide level.<br/>Further, the nucleotide percent similarity was 55.4%,<br/>45.5% to 47.9%, 46.2% to 46.6%, and 45.0% to<br/>46.3% to the other four subgenera, namely,<br/>Hibecovirus, Nobecovirus, Merbecovirus, and<br/>Embecovirus, respectively. The percent similarity<br/>index of current outbreak isolates indicates a close<br/>relationship between SARS-CoV-2 isolates and bat-<br/>SL-CoV, indicating a common origin. However,<br/>particular pieces of evidence based on _ further<br/>complete genomic analysis of current isolates are<br/>necessary to draw any conclusions, although it was<br/>ascertained that the current novel SARS-CoV-2<br/>isolates belong to the subgenus Sarbecovirus in the<br/>diverse range of betacoronaviruses. Their possible<br/>ancestor was hypothesized to be from bat CoV<br/>strains, wherein bats might have played a crucial role<br/><br/>in harboring this class of viruses.
