epidemics (13). The most common symptoms associated with COVID-19 are fever, cough, dyspnea, expectoration, headache, and myalgia or fatigue.<br/>In contrast, less common signs at the time of hospital admission include diarrhea, hemoptysis, and shortness of breath (14). Recently, individuals with asymptomatic infections were also suspected of transmitting infections, which further adds to the complexity of disease transmission dynamics in COVID-19 infections (1). Such efficient responses require in-depth knowledge regarding the virus, which currently is a novel agent; consequently, further studies are required.<br/>Comparing the genome of SARS-CoV-2 with that of the closely related SARS/SARS-like CoV revealed that the sequence coding for the spike protein, with a total length of 1,273 amino acids, showed 27 amino acid substitutions. Six of these substitutions are in the region of the receptor-binding domain (RBD), and another six substitutions are in the underpinning subdomain (SD) (16). Phylogenetic analyses have revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is closely related (88% similarity) to two SARS-like CoVs derived from bat SARS-like CoVs_ (bat-SL- â€œOVZCAS | bat-SL-CoV7XC2 Fj
