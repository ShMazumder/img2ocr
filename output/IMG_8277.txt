epidemics (13). The most common symptoms<br/>associated with COVID-19 are fever, cough,<br/>dyspnea, expectoration, headache, and myalgia or<br/>fatigue.<br/><br/>In contrast, less common signs at the time of<br/>hospital admission include diarrhea, hemoptysis, and<br/>shortness of breath (14). Recently, individuals with<br/>asymptomatic infections were also suspected of<br/>transmitting infections, which further adds to the<br/>complexity of disease transmission dynamics in<br/>COVID-19 infections (1). Such efficient responses<br/>require in-depth knowledge regarding the virus,<br/>which currently is a novel agent; consequently,<br/>further studies are required.<br/><br/>Comparing the genome of SARS-CoV-2 with that<br/>of the closely related SARS/SARS-like CoV<br/>revealed that the sequence coding for the spike<br/>protein, with a total length of 1,273 amino acids,<br/>showed 27 amino acid substitutions. Six of these<br/>substitutions are in the region of the receptor-binding<br/>domain (RBD), and another six substitutions are in<br/>the underpinning subdomain (SD) (16). Phylogenetic<br/>analyses have revealed that SARS-CoV-2 is closely<br/>related (88% similarity) to two SARS-like CoVs<br/>derived from bat SARS-like CoVs_ (bat-SL-<br/>â€œOVZCAS | bat-SL-CoV7XC2 Fj
