detected SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in cat<br/>serum samples collected in Wuhan after the COVID-19<br/>outbreak, providing evidence for SARS-CoV-2 infection<br/>in cat populations in Wuhan, although the potential<br/>of SARS-CoV-2 transmission from cats to humans is<br/><br/>currently uncertain®.<br/><br/>Receptor use and pathogenesis<br/><br/>SARS-CoV-2 uses the same receptor as SARS-CoV,<br/>angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)''"’. Besides<br/>human ACE2 (hACE2), SARS-CoV-2 also recognizes<br/>ACE2 from pig, ferret, rhesus monkey, civet, cat, pan-<br/>golin, rabbit and dog''****”. The broad receptor usage<br/>of SARS-CoV-2 implies that it may have a wide host<br/>range, and the varied efficiency of ACE2 usage in differ-<br/>ent animals may indicate their different susceptibilities<br/>to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The $1 subunit of a corona-<br/>virus is further divided into two functional domains,<br/>an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain.<br/>Structural and biochemical analyses identified a<br/>211 amino acid region (amino acids 319-529) at the S1<br/>C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 as the RBD, which<br/>has a key role in virus entry and is the target of neu-<br/>tralizing antibodies”! (FIG. 5a). The RBM mediates con-<br/>tact with the ACE2 receptor (amino acids 437-507 of<br/>SARS-CoV-2 S protein), and this region in SARS-CoV-2<br/>differs from that in SARS-CoV in the five residues crit-
