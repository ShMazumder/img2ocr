class I viral transmembrane protein. The size of this
abundant S protein varies from 1,160 amino acids
(IBV, infectious bronchitis virus, in poultry) to 1,400
amino acids (FCoV, feline coronavirus) (43). It lies
in a trimer on the virion surface, giving the virion a
corona or crown-like appearance. Functionally it is
required for the entry of the infectious virion
particles into the cell through interaction with
various host cellular receptors (44).

Furthermore, it acts as a critical factor for tissue
tropism and the determination of host range (45).
Notably, S protein is one of the vital
immunodominant proteins of CoVs capable of
inducing host immune responses (45). The
ectodomains in all CoVs S proteins have similar
domain organizations, divided into two subunits, S1
and S2 (43). The first one, $1, helps in host receptor
binding, while the second one, S2, accounts for
fusion. The former (S1) is further divided into two
subdomains, namely, the N-terminal domain (NTD)
and C-terminal domain (CTD). Both of these
subdomains act as_ receptor-binding domains,
interacting efficiently with various host receptors
(45). The Sl CTD contains the receptor-binding
motif (RBM). In each coronavirus spike protein, the
trimeric S1 locates itself on top of the trimeric S2
