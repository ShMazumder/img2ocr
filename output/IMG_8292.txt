abundant S protein varies from 1,160 amino acids<br/>(IBV, infectious bronchitis virus, in poultry) to 1,400<br/>amino acids (FCoV, feline coronavirus) (43). It lies<br/>in a trimer on the virion surface, giving the virion a<br/>corona or crown-like appearance. Functionally it is<br/>required for the entry of the infectious virion<br/>particles into the cell through interaction with<br/>various host cellular receptors (44).<br/><br/>Furthermore, it acts as a critical factor for tissue<br/>tropism and the determination of host range (45).<br/>Notably, S protein is one of the vital<br/>immunodominant proteins of CoVs capable of<br/>inducing host immune responses (45). The<br/>ectodomains in all CoVs S proteins have similar<br/>domain organizations, divided into two subunits, S1<br/>and S2 (43). The first one, $1, helps in host receptor<br/>binding, while the second one, S2, accounts for<br/>fusion. The former (S1) is further divided into two<br/>subdomains, namely, the N-terminal domain (NTD)<br/>and C-terminal domain (CTD). Both of these<br/>subdomains act as_ receptor-binding domains,<br/>interacting efficiently with various host receptors<br/>(45). The Sl CTD contains the receptor-binding<br/>motif (RBM). In each coronavirus spike protein, the<br/>trimeric S1 locates itself on top of the trimeric S2
