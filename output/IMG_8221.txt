from Wuhan is a recombinant virus of the bat<br/>coronavirus and another coronavirus of unknown<br/>origin. The recombination was found to have<br/>happened within the viral spike glycoprotein, which<br/>recognizes the cell surface receptor. Further analysis<br/>of the genome based on codon usage identified the<br/>snake as the most probable animal reservoir of<br/>SARS-CoV-2 (143). Contrary to these findings,<br/>another genome analysis proposed that the genome<br/>of SARS-CoV-2 is 96% identical to bat coronavirus,<br/>reflecting its origin from bats (63). The involvement<br/>of bat-derived materials in causing the current<br/>outbreak cannot be ruled out. High risk is involved<br/>in the production of bat-derived materials for TCM<br/>practices involving the handling of wild bats. The<br/>use of bats for TCM practices will remain a severe<br/>risk for the occurrence of zoonotic coronavirus<br/>epidemics in the future (139).<br/><br/>Furthermore, the pangolins are an endangered<br/>species of animals that harbor a wide variety of<br/>viruses, including coronaviruses (144). The<br/>coronavirus isolated from Malayan pangolins (Manis<br/>javanica) showed a very high amino acid identity<br/>with COVID-19 at E (100%), M (98.2%), N<br/>(96.7%), and S genes (90.4%).
