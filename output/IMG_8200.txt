44% of the frontline health-care workers from a hosp were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (REF).<br/>The high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 may be attributed to the unique virological features o SARS-CoV-2. Transmission of SARS-CoV occurred mainly after illness onset and peaked following dis- ease severity”’. However, the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in upper respiratory tract samples was already high- est during the first week of symptoms, and thus the risk of pharyngeal virus shedding was very high a the beginning of infection”””. It was postulated tha undocumented infections might account for 79% o: documented cases owing to the high transmissibility of the virus during mild disease or the asymptomatic period’. A patient with COVID-19 spreads viruses in liquid droplets during speech. However, smaller and much more numerous particles known as aerosol parti- cles can also be visualized, which could linger in the air for a long time and then penetrate deep into the lungs when inhaled by someone else”*"'. Airborne trans- mission was also observed in the ferret experiments mentioned above. SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets shed
