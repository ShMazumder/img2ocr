44% of the frontline health-care workers from a hosp<br/>were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (REF).<br/><br/>The high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 may<br/>be attributed to the unique virological features o<br/>SARS-CoV-2. Transmission of SARS-CoV occurred<br/>mainly after illness onset and peaked following dis-<br/>ease severity”’. However, the SARS-CoV-2 viral load<br/>in upper respiratory tract samples was already high-<br/>est during the first week of symptoms, and thus the<br/>risk of pharyngeal virus shedding was very high a<br/>the beginning of infection”””. It was postulated tha<br/>undocumented infections might account for 79% o:<br/>documented cases owing to the high transmissibility<br/>of the virus during mild disease or the asymptomatic<br/>period’. A patient with COVID-19 spreads viruses in<br/>liquid droplets during speech. However, smaller and<br/>much more numerous particles known as aerosol parti-<br/>cles can also be visualized, which could linger in the air<br/>for a long time and then penetrate deep into the lungs<br/>when inhaled by someone else”*"'. Airborne trans-<br/>mission was also observed in the ferret experiments<br/>mentioned above. SARS-CoV-2-infected ferrets shed
