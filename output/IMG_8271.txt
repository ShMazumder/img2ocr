minimum signs and symptoms (82). Another study, conducted in South Korea, related to SARS-CoV-2 viral load, opined that SARS-CoV-2 kinetics were significantly different from those of earlier reported CoV infections, including SARS-CoV (253). SARS- CoV-2 transmission can occur early in the viral infection phase; thus, diagnosing cases and isolation attempts for this virus warrant different strategies than those needed to counter SARS-CoV. Studies are required to establish any correlation between SARS- CoV-2 viral load and cultivable virus. Recognizing patients with fewer or no symptoms, along with having modest detectable viral RNA in_ the oropharynx for 5 days, indicates the requirement of data for assessing SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and updating the screening procedures in the clinics (82).
