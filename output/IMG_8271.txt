minimum signs and symptoms (82). Another study,<br/>conducted in South Korea, related to SARS-CoV-2<br/>viral load, opined that SARS-CoV-2 kinetics were<br/>significantly different from those of earlier reported<br/>CoV infections, including SARS-CoV (253). SARS-<br/>CoV-2 transmission can occur early in the viral<br/>infection phase; thus, diagnosing cases and isolation<br/>attempts for this virus warrant different strategies<br/>than those needed to counter SARS-CoV. Studies are<br/>required to establish any correlation between SARS-<br/>CoV-2 viral load and cultivable virus. Recognizing<br/>patients with fewer or no symptoms, along with<br/>having modest detectable viral RNA in_ the<br/>oropharynx for 5 days, indicates the requirement of<br/>data for assessing SARS-CoV-2 transmission<br/>dynamics and updating the screening procedures in<br/>the clinics (82).
