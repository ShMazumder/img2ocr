chronic diseases, especially high blood pressure and<br/>diabetes, were found to be more susceptible to<br/>respiratory failure and, therefore, had poorer<br/>prognoses. Providing respiratory support at early<br/>stages improved the disease prognosis and facilitated<br/>recovery (18). The ARDS in COVID-19 is due to the<br/>occurrence of cytokine storms that results in<br/>exaggerated immune response, immune regulatory<br/>network imbalance, and, finally, miultiple-organ<br/>failure (122). In addition to the exaggerated<br/>inflammatory response seen in patients with<br/>COVID-19 pneumonia, the bile duct epithelial cell-<br/>derived hepatocytes upregulate ACE2 expression in<br/>liver tissue by compensatory proliferation that might<br/>result in hepatic tissue injury (123).<br/><br/>CORONAVIRUSES IN ANIMALS AND<br/>ZOONOTIC LINKSâ€”A BRIEF<br/>VIEWPOINT<br/><br/>Coronavirus can cause disease in several species<br/>of domestic and wild animals, as well as humans<br/>(23). The different animal species that are infected<br/>with CoV include horses, camels, cattle, swine, dogs,<br/>cats, rodents, birds, ferrets, minks, bats, rabbits,<br/>snakes, and various other wild animals (20, 30, 79,
