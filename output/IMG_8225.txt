countries have provided recommendations to their<br/>people traveling to China (88, 89). Compared to the<br/>previous coronavirus outbreaks caused by SARS-<br/>CoV and MERS-CoV, the efficiency of SARS-CoV-<br/>2 human-to-human transmission was thought to be<br/>less. This assumption was based on the finding that<br/>health workers were affected less than they were in<br/>previous outbreaks of fatal coronaviruses (2).<br/>Superspreading events are considered the main<br/>culprit for the extensive transmission of SARS and<br/>MERS (90, 91). Almost half of the MERS-CoV<br/>cases reported in Saudi Arabia are of secondary<br/>origin that occurred through contact with infected<br/>asymptomatic or symptomatic individuals through<br/>human-to-human transmission (92). The occurrence<br/>of superspreading events in the COVID-19 outbreak<br/>cannot be ruled out until its possibility is evaluated.<br/>Like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 can also infect<br/>the lower respiratory tract, with milder symptoms<br/>(27). The basic reproduction number of COVID-19<br/>has been found to be in the range of 2.8 to 3.3 based<br/>on real-time reports and 3.2 to 3.9 based on predicted<br/>infected cases (84).
