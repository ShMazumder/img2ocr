infected by human-to-human transmission (14).<br/><br/>The initial trends suggested that the mortality<br/>associated with COVID-19 was less than that of<br/>previous outbreaks of SARS (101). The updates<br/>obtained from countries like China, Japan, Thailand,<br/>and South Korea indicated that the COVID-19<br/>patients had relatively mild manifestations compared<br/>to those with SARS and MERS (4). Regardless of<br/>the coronavirus type, immune cells, like mast cells,<br/>that are present in the submucosa of the respiratory<br/>tract and nasal cavity are considered the primary<br/>barrier against this virus (92). Advanced in-depth<br/>analysis of the genome has identified 380 amino acid<br/>substitutions between the amino acid sequences of<br/>SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS/SARS-like<br/>coronaviruses. These differences in the amino acid<br/>sequences might have contributed to the difference<br/>in the pathogenic divergence of SARS-CoV-2 (16).<br/>Further research is required to evaluate the possible<br/>differences in tropism, pathogenesis, and<br/>transmission of this novel agent associated with this<br/>change in the amino acid sequence. With the current<br/>outbreak of COVID-19, there is an expectancy of a<br/>significant increase in the number of published<br/>studies about this emerging coronavirus, as occurred
