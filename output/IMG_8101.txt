CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing tool has been used for<br/>inserting genomic alterations in mice, making them<br/>susceptible to MERS-CoV infection (222). Efforts<br/>are under way to recognize suitable animal models<br/>for SARS-CoV2/COVID-19, identify the receptor<br/>affinity of this virus, study pathology in experimental<br/>animal models, and explore virus-specific immune<br/>responses and protection studies, which together<br/>would increase the pace of efforts being made for<br/>developing potent vaccines and drugs to counter this<br/>emerging virus. Cell lines, such as monkey epithelial<br/>cell lines (LLC-MK2 and Vero-B4), goat lung cells,<br/>alpaca kidney cells, dromedary umbilical cord cells,<br/>and advanced ex _ vivo _ three-dimensional<br/>tracheobronchial tissue, have been explored to study<br/>human CoVs (MERS-CoV) (223, 224). Vero and<br/>Huh-7 cells (human liver cancer cells) have been<br/>used for isolating SARS-CoV-2 (194).<br/><br/>Recently, an experimental study with rhesus<br/>monkeys as animal models revealed the absence of<br/>any viral loads in nasopharyngeal and anal swabs,<br/>and no viral replication was recorded in the primary<br/>tissues at a time interval of 5 days post-reinfection in<br/>reexposed monkeys (274). The subsequent<br/>virological, radiological, and _ pathological
