in another case study, the authors raised concerns<br/>over the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine-<br/>azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19 patients,<br/>since no observable effect was seen when they were<br/>used. In some cases, the treatment was discontinued<br/>due to the prolongation of the QT interval (307).<br/>Hence, further randomized clinical trials are required<br/>before concluding this matter.<br/><br/>Recently, another FDA-approved drug,<br/>ivermectin, was reported to inhibit the in vitro<br/>replication of SARS-CoV-2. The findings from this<br/>study indicate that a single treatment of this drug was<br/>able to induce an ~5,000-fold reduction in the viral<br/>RNA at 48 h in cell culture. (308). One of the main<br/>disadvantages that limit the clinical utility of<br/>ivermectin is its potential to cause cytotoxicity.<br/>However, altering the vehicles used in_ the<br/>formulations, the pharmacokinetic properties can be<br/>modified, thereby having significant control over the<br/>systemic concentration of ivermectin (338). Based<br/>on the pharmacokinetic simulation, it was also found<br/>that ivermectin may have limited therapeutic utility<br/>in managing COVID-19, since the inhibitory<br/>concentration that has to be achieved for effective<br/>anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity is far higher than the
