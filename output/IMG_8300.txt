SARS-CoV-2 remains incomplete to a large part. The<br/>reservoir hosts of the virus have not been clearly proven.<br/>It is unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted<br/>to humans through an intermediate host and which<br/>animals may act as its intermediate host. Detection o<br/>RaTG13, RmYNO02 and pangolin coronaviruses implies<br/>that diverse coronaviruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 are<br/>circulating in wildlife. In addition, as previous stud-<br/>ies showed recombination as the potential origin o<br/>some sarbecoviruses such as SARS-CoV, it cannot be<br/>excluded that viral RNA recombination among differen<br/>related coronaviruses was involved in the evolution o<br/>SARS-CoV-2. Extensive surveillance of SARS-CoV-2-<br/>related viruses in China, Southeast Asia and other<br/>regions targeting bats, wild and captured pangolins and<br/>other wildlife species will help us to better understand<br/>the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.<br/><br/>Besides wildlife, researchers investigated the sus-<br/>ceptibility of domesticated and laboratory animals to<br/>SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study demonstrated exper-<br/>imentally that SARS-CoV-2 replicates efficiently in cats<br/>and in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets, whereas<br/>dogs, pigs, chickens and ducks were not susceptible to<br/>SARS-CoV-2 (REF.“). The susceptibility of minks was<br/>documented by a report from the Netherlands on an<br/>outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in farmed minks.<br/>Although the symptoms in most infected minks were<br/>mild, some developed severe respiratory distress<br/>and died of interstitial pneumonia“*. Both virologi-<br/>cal and serological testing found evidence for natural<br/>SARS-CoV-2 infection in two dogs from households with<br/>human cases of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, but the dogs
