SARS-CoV-2 remains incomplete to a large part. The reservoir hosts of the virus have not been clearly proven. It is unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted to humans through an intermediate host and which animals may act as its intermediate host. Detection o RaTG13, RmYNO02 and pangolin coronaviruses implies that diverse coronaviruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 are circulating in wildlife. In addition, as previous stud- ies showed recombination as the potential origin o some sarbecoviruses such as SARS-CoV, it cannot be excluded that viral RNA recombination among differen related coronaviruses was involved in the evolution o SARS-CoV-2. Extensive surveillance of SARS-CoV-2- related viruses in China, Southeast Asia and other regions targeting bats, wild and captured pangolins and other wildlife species will help us to better understand the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2. Besides wildlife, researchers investigated the sus- ceptibility of domesticated and laboratory animals to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study demonstrated exper- imentally that SARS-CoV-2 replicates efficiently in cats and in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets, whereas dogs, pigs, chickens and ducks were not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 (REF.“). The susceptibility of minks was documented by a report from the Netherlands on an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in farmed minks. Although the symptoms in most infected minks were mild, some developed severe respiratory distress and died of interstitial pneumonia“*. Both virologi- cal and serological testing found evidence for natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in two dogs from households with human cases of COVID-19 in Hong Kong, but the dogs
