(249-252). Future explorative research needs to be<br/>conducted with regard to the fecal-oral transmission<br/>of SARS-CoV-2, along with focusing on<br/>environmental investigations to find out if this virus<br/>could stay viable in situations and atmospheres<br/>facilitating such potent routes of transmission. The<br/>correlation of fecal concentrations of viral RNA with<br/>disease severity needs to be determined, along with<br/>assessing the gastrointestinal symptoms and the<br/>possibility of fecal SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection<br/>during the COVID-19 incubation period or<br/>convalescence phases of the disease (249-252).<br/><br/>The lower respiratory tract sampling techniques,<br/>like bronchoalveolar lavage fluid aspirate, are<br/>considered the ideal clinical materials, rather than<br/>the throat swab, due to their higher positive rate on<br/>the nucleic acid test (148). The diagnosis of COVID-<br/>19 can be made by using upper-respiratory-tract<br/>specimens collected using nasopharyngeal and<br/>oropharyngeal swabs. However, these techniques are<br/>associated with unnecessary risks to health care<br/>workers due to close contact with patients (152).<br/>Similarly, a single patient with a high viral load was<br/>reported to contaminate an entire endoscopy room by<br/>shedding the virus, which may remain viable for at
