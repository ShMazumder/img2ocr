disease outbreaks that have not been controlled to<br/>date, although extensive efforts are being put in<br/>place to counter this virus (25). This virus has been<br/>proposed to be designated/named severe acute<br/>respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)<br/>by the International Committee on Taxonomy of<br/>Viruses (ICTV), which determined the virus belongs<br/>to the Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related<br/>coronavirus category and found this virus is related<br/>to SARS-CoVs (26). SARS-CoV-2 is a member of<br/>the order WNidovirales, family Coronaviridae,<br/>subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, which is subdivided<br/><br/>into four genera, viz., | Alphacoronavirus,<br/>Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and<br/>Deltacoronavirus (3, 27). The genera<br/><br/>Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus originate<br/>from bats, while =Gammacoronavirus and<br/>Deltacoronavirus have evolved from bird and swine<br/>gene pools (24, 28, 29, 275).<br/><br/>Coronaviruses possess an unsegmented, single-<br/>stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of around 30<br/>kb, enclosed by a 5'-cap and 3’-poly(A) tail (30). The<br/>genome of SARS-CoV-2 is 29,891 bp long, with a<br/>G+C content of 38% (31). These viruses are<br/>encircled with an envelope containing — viral
