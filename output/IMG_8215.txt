In such cases where the patients progress toward<br/>respiratory failure and become refractory to oxygen<br/>therapy, mechanical ventilation is necessitated. The<br/>COVID-19-induced septic shock can be managed by<br/>providing adequate hemodynamic support (299).<br/>Several classes of drugs are currently being<br/>evaluated for their potential therapeutic action<br/>against SARS-CoV-2. Therapeutic agents that have<br/>anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity can be broadly classified<br/>into three categories: drugs that block virus entry<br/>into the host cell, drugs that block viral replication as<br/>well as its survival within the host cell, and drugs<br/>that attenuate the exaggerated host immune response<br/>(300). An inflammatory cytokine storm is commonly<br/>seen in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Hence, they<br/>may benefit from the use of timely anti-inflammation<br/>treatment. Anti-inflammatory therapy using drugs<br/>like glucocorticoids, cytokine inhibitors, JAK<br/>inhibitors, and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine<br/>should be done only after analyzing the risk/benefit<br/>ratio in COVID-19 patients (301). There have not<br/>been any studies concerning the application of<br/>nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) to<br/>COVID-19-infected patients. However, reasonable<br/>pieces of evidence are available that link NSAID
