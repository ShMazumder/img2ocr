In such cases where the patients progress toward respiratory failure and become refractory to oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation is necessitated. The COVID-19-induced septic shock can be managed by providing adequate hemodynamic support (299). Several classes of drugs are currently being evaluated for their potential therapeutic action against SARS-CoV-2. Therapeutic agents that have anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity can be broadly classified into three categories: drugs that block virus entry into the host cell, drugs that block viral replication as well as its survival within the host cell, and drugs that attenuate the exaggerated host immune response (300). An inflammatory cytokine storm is commonly seen in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Hence, they may benefit from the use of timely anti-inflammation treatment. Anti-inflammatory therapy using drugs like glucocorticoids, cytokine inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine should be done only after analyzing the risk/benefit ratio in COVID-19 patients (301). There have not been any studies concerning the application of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) to COVID-19-infected patients. However, reasonable pieces of evidence are available that link NSAID
