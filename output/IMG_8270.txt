world is on the rise. The success of preventive<br/>measures put forward by every country is mainly<br/>dependent upon their ability to anticipate the<br/>approaching waves of patients. This will help to<br/>properly prepare the health care workers and<br/>increase the intensive care unit (ICU) capacity (321).<br/>Instead of entirely relying on lockdown protocols,<br/>countries should focus mainly on _ alternative<br/>intervention strategies, such as large-scale testing,<br/>contract tracing, and localized quarantine of<br/>suspected cases for limiting the spread of this<br/>pandemic virus. Such intervention strategies will be<br/>useful either at the beginning of the pandemic or<br/>after lockdown relaxation (322). Lockdown should<br/>be imposed only to slow down disease progression<br/>among the population so that the health care system<br/>is not overloaded.<br/><br/>The reproduction number (Ro) of COVID-19<br/>infection was earlier estimated to be in the range of<br/>1.4 to 2.5 (70); recently, it was estimated to be 2.24<br/>to 3.58 (76). Compared to its coronavirus<br/>predecessors, COVID-19 has an Rg value that is<br/>greater than that of MERS (Ro < 1) (108) but less<br/>than that of SARS (Ro value of 2 to 5) (93). Still, to<br/>prevent further spread of disease at mass gatherings,
