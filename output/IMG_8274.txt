made to design and develop vaccines for CoV<br/>infection, mostly by targeting the spike glycoprotein.<br/>Nevertheless, owing to extensive diversity in<br/>antigenic variants, cross-protection rendered by the<br/>vaccines is significantly limited, even within the<br/>strains of a phylogenetic subcluster (104). Due to the<br/>lack of effective antiviral therapy and vaccines in the<br/>present scenario, we need to depend solely on<br/>implementing effective infection control measures to<br/>lessen the risk of possible nosocomial transmission<br/>(68). Recently, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 was<br/>established as the human angiotensin-converting<br/>enzyme 2 (hACE2), and the virus was found to enter<br/>the host cell mainly through endocytosis. It was also<br/>found that the major components that have a critical<br/>role in viral entry include PIKfyve, TPC2, and<br/>cathepsin L. These findings are critical, since the<br/>components described above might act as candidates<br/>for vaccines or therapeutic drugs against SARS-<br/>CoV-2 (293).<br/><br/>The majority of the treatment options and<br/>strategies that are being evaluated for SARS-CoV-2<br/>(COVID-19) have been taken from our previous<br/>experiences in treating SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and<br/>other emerging viral diseases. Several therapeutic
