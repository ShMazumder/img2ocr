nature of this novel virus (36, 189). Presently, the<br/>main course of treatment for severely affected<br/>SARS-CoV-2 patients admitted to hospitals includes<br/>mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU)<br/>admittance, and symptomatic and _ supportive<br/>therapies. Additionally, RNA synthesis inhibitors<br/>(lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate),<br/>remdesivir, neuraminidase inhibitors, peptide (EK 1),<br/>anti-inflammatory drugs, abidol, and Chinese<br/>traditional medicine (Lianhuagingwen â€” and<br/>ShuFengJieDu capsules) could aid in COVID-19<br/>treatment. However, further clinical trials are being<br/>carried out concerning their safety and efficacy (7).<br/>It might require months to a year(s) to design and<br/>develop effective drugs, therapeutics, and vaccines<br/>against COVID-19, with adequate evaluation and<br/>approval from regulatory bodies and moving to the<br/>bulk production of many millions of doses at<br/>commercial levels to meet the timely demand of<br/>mass populations across the globe (9). Continuous<br/>efforts are also warranted to identify and assess<br/>viable drugs and immunotherapeutic regimens that<br/>revealed proven potency in combating other viral<br/>agents similar to SARS-CoV-2.<br/><br/>COVID-19 patients showing severe signs are
