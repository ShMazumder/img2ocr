(40, 41).<br/><br/>Coronavirus genomes and subgenomes encode<br/>six ORFs (31). The majority of the 5’ end is occupied<br/>by ORFla/b, which produces 16 nsps. The two<br/>polyproteins, ppla and pplab, are initially produced<br/>from ORFla/b by a —1 frameshift between ORFla<br/>and ORF 1b (32). The virus-encoded proteases cleave<br/>polyproteins into individual nsps (main protease<br/>[Mpro], chymotrypsin-like protease [3CLpro], and<br/>papain-like proteases [PLPs]) (42). SARS-CoV-2<br/>also encodes these nsps, and their functions have<br/>been elucidated recently (31). Remarkably, a<br/>difference between SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs is<br/>the identification of a novel short putative protein<br/>within the ORF3 band, a secreted protein with an<br/>alpha helix and beta-sheet with six strands encoded<br/>by ORF8 (31).<br/><br/>Coronaviruses encode four major structural<br/>proteins, namely, spike (S), membrane (M), envelope<br/>(E), and nucleocapsid (N), which are described in<br/>detail below.<br/><br/>S Glycoprotein<br/>Coronavirus S protein is a large, multifunctional<br/>class I viral transmembrane protein.
