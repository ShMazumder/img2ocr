For evaluating the potential of vaccines and
therapeutics against CoVs, including SARS-CoV,
MERS-CoVs, and the presently emerging SARS-
CoV-2, suitable animal models that can mimic the
clinical disease are needed (211, 212). Various
animal models were assessed for SARS- and MERS-
CoVs, such as mice, guinea pigs, golden Syrian
hamsters, ferrets, rabbits, nonhuman primates like
rhesus macaques and marmosets, and cats (185,
213-218). The specificity of the virus to hACE2
(receptor of SARS-CoV) was found to be a
significant barrier in developing animal models.
Consequently, a SARS-CoV transgenic mouse model
has been developed by inserting the hACE2 gene
into the mouse genome (219). The inability of
MERS-CoV to replicate in the respiratory tracts of
animals (mice, hamsters, and ferrets) is another
limiting factor. However, with genetic engineering, a
288-330'/* MERS-CoV genetically modified mouse
model was developed and now is in use for the
assessment of novel drugs and vaccines against
MERS-CoV (220). In the past, small animals (mice
or hamsters) have been targeted for being closer to a
humanized structure, such as mouse DPP4 altered
with human DPP4 (hDPP4), hDPP4-transduced
mice. and hDPP4-Tg mice (transgenic for expressing
