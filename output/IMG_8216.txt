<br/>For evaluating the potential of vaccines and<br/>therapeutics against CoVs, including SARS-CoV,<br/>MERS-CoVs, and the presently emerging SARS-<br/>CoV-2, suitable animal models that can mimic the<br/>clinical disease are needed (211, 212). Various<br/>animal models were assessed for SARS- and MERS-<br/>CoVs, such as mice, guinea pigs, golden Syrian<br/>hamsters, ferrets, rabbits, nonhuman primates like<br/>rhesus macaques and marmosets, and cats (185,<br/>213-218). The specificity of the virus to hACE2<br/>(receptor of SARS-CoV) was found to be a<br/>significant barrier in developing animal models.<br/>Consequently, a SARS-CoV transgenic mouse model<br/>has been developed by inserting the hACE2 gene<br/>into the mouse genome (219). The inability of<br/>MERS-CoV to replicate in the respiratory tracts of<br/>animals (mice, hamsters, and ferrets) is another<br/>limiting factor. However, with genetic engineering, a<br/>288-330'/* MERS-CoV genetically modified mouse<br/>model was developed and now is in use for the<br/>assessment of novel drugs and vaccines against<br/>MERS-CoV (220). In the past, small animals (mice<br/>or hamsters) have been targeted for being closer to a<br/>humanized structure, such as mouse DPP4 altered<br/>with human DPP4 (hDPP4), hDPP4-transduced<br/>mice. and hDPP4-Tg mice (transgenic for expressing
