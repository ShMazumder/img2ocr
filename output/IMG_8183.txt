<br/>Several years after the global SARS epidemic,<br/>the current SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic has<br/>served as a reminder of how novel pathogens can<br/>rapidly emerge and spread through the human<br/>population and eventually cause severe public health<br/>crises. Further research should be conducted to<br/>establish animal models for SARS-CoV-2_ to<br/>investigate replication, transmission dynamics, and<br/>pathogenesis in humans. This may help develop and<br/>evaluate potential therapeutic strategies against<br/>zoonotic CoV epidemics. Present trends suggest the<br/>occurrence of future outbreaks of CoVs due to<br/>changes in the climate, and ecological conditions<br/>may be associated with human-animal contact. Live-<br/>animal markets, such as the Huanan South China<br/>Seafood Market, represent ideal conditions for<br/>interspecies contact of wildlife with domestic birds,<br/>pigs, and mammals, which substantially increases<br/>the probability of interspecies transmission of CoV<br/>infections and could result in high risks to humans<br/>due to adaptive genetic recombination in these<br/>viruses (323-325).<br/><br/>The COVID-19-associated symptoms are fever,<br/>cough, expectoration, headache, and myalgia or<br/>fatigue. Individuals with asymptomatic and atypical
