4 VIROLOGY

Coronaviruses, a family of viruses within the
nidoviruses superfamily, are further classified
according to their genera, alpha-, beta-, gamma-
and deltacoronaviruses (a-, B-, y- and 5-).
Among those, alpha and beta species are
capable of contaminating only mammals,
whereas the other two genera can infect birds
and could also infect mammals.'* '* Two of
these genera belong to human coronaviruses
(HCoVs): a-coronaviruses, which comprise
human coronavirus 229E (hcov229E) and
human coronavirus NL63 (hCovNL63), and B-
coronaviruses, which are human coronavirus
HKU1, human coronavirus OC43, MERS-COV
(known as Middle East respiratory syndrome
coronavirus) and SARS-CoV (referred to as
severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus). '°

The severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2
(SARS-CoV-2) is now named novel COVID-19
(coronavirus disease 2019).'° Genome
sequencing and phylogenetic research revealed
that the COVID-19-causing coronavirus is a
beta-coronavirus that belongs to the same
subtypes as SARS virus, but still exists in a
variant group. The receptor- binding gene region
