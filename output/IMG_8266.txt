<br/>Coronaviruses, a family of viruses within the<br/>nidoviruses superfamily, are further classified<br/>according to their genera, alpha-, beta-, gamma-<br/>and deltacoronaviruses (a-, B-, y- and 5-).<br/>Among those, alpha and beta species are<br/>capable of contaminating only mammals,<br/>whereas the other two genera can infect birds<br/>and could also infect mammals.'* '* Two of<br/>these genera belong to human coronaviruses<br/>(HCoVs): a-coronaviruses, which comprise<br/>human coronavirus 229E (hcov229E) and<br/>human coronavirus NL63 (hCovNL63), and B-<br/>coronaviruses, which are human coronavirus<br/>HKU1, human coronavirus OC43, MERS-COV<br/>(known as Middle East respiratory syndrome<br/>coronavirus) and SARS-CoV (referred to as<br/>severe acute respiratory syndrome<br/>coronavirus). '°<br/><br/>The severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2<br/>(SARS-CoV-2) is now named novel COVID-19<br/>(coronavirus disease 2019).'° Genome<br/>sequencing and phylogenetic research revealed<br/>that the COVID-19-causing coronavirus is a<br/>beta-coronavirus that belongs to the same<br/>subtypes as SARS virus, but still exists in a<br/>variant group.
