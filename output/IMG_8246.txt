The results of the studies related to SARS-CoV-2
viral loads reflect active replication of this virus in
the upper respiratory tract and prolonged viral
shedding after symptoms disappear, including via
stool. Thus, the current case definition needs to be
updated along with a reassessment of the strategies
to be adopted for restraining the SARS-CoV-2
outbreak spread (248). In some cases, the viral load
studies of SARS-CoV-2 have also been useful to
recommend precautionary measures when handling
specific samples, e.g., feces. In a recent survey from
17 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection with
available data (representing days 0 to 13 after onset),
stool samples from nine cases (53%; days 0 to 11
after onset) were positive on RT-PCR analysis.
Although the viral loads were lower than those of
respiratory samples (range, 550 copies per ml to
1.21 x 10Â° copies per ml), this has essential biosafety
implications (151).

The samples from 18 SARS-CoV-2-positive
patients in Singapore who had traveled from Wuhan
to Singapore showed the presence of viral RNA in
stool and whole blood but not in urine by real-time
RT-PCR (288). Further, novel SARS-CoV-2
infections have been detected in a variety of clinical
specimens, like bronchoalveolar lavage fluid,
