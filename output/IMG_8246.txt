viral loads reflect active replication of this virus in<br/>the upper respiratory tract and prolonged viral<br/>shedding after symptoms disappear, including via<br/>stool. Thus, the current case definition needs to be<br/>updated along with a reassessment of the strategies<br/>to be adopted for restraining the SARS-CoV-2<br/>outbreak spread (248). In some cases, the viral load<br/>studies of SARS-CoV-2 have also been useful to<br/>recommend precautionary measures when handling<br/>specific samples, e.g., feces. In a recent survey from<br/>17 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection with<br/>available data (representing days 0 to 13 after onset),<br/>stool samples from nine cases (53%; days 0 to 11<br/>after onset) were positive on RT-PCR analysis.<br/>Although the viral loads were lower than those of<br/>respiratory samples (range, 550 copies per ml to<br/>1.21 x 10Â° copies per ml), this has essential biosafety<br/>implications (151).<br/><br/>The samples from 18 SARS-CoV-2-positive<br/>patients in Singapore who had traveled from Wuhan<br/>to Singapore showed the presence of viral RNA in<br/>stool and whole blood but not in urine by real-time<br/>RT-PCR (288). Further, novel SARS-CoV-2<br/>infections have been detected in a variety of clinical<br/>specimens, like bronchoalveolar lavage fluid,
