humanized nanobodies (single-domain antibodies;<br/>sdAb, VH/VHH) could aid in blocking virus<br/>replication, as these agents can traverse the virus-<br/>infected cell membranes (transbodies) and can<br/>interfere with the biological characteristics of the<br/>replicating virus proteins. Such examples include<br/>transbodies to the influenza virus, hepatitis C virus,<br/>Ebola virus, and dengue virus (206). Producing<br/>similar transbodies against intracellular proteins of<br/>coronaviruses, such as papain-like proteases (PLpro),<br/>cysteine-like protease (3CLpro), or other nsps, which<br/>are essential for replication and transcription of the<br/>virus, might formulate a practical move forward for a<br/>safer and potent passive immunization approach for<br/>virus-exposed persons and rendering therapy to<br/>infected patients.<br/><br/>In a case study on five grimly sick patients<br/>having symptoms of severe pneumonia due to<br/>COVID-19, convalescent plasma administration was<br/>found to be helpful in patients recovering<br/>successfully. The convalescent plasma containing a<br/>SARS-CoV-2-specific ELISA (serum) antibody titer<br/>higher than 1:1,000 and neutralizing antibody titer<br/>more significant than 40 was collected from the<br/>recovered patients and used for plasma transfusion
