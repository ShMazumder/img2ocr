humanized nanobodies (single-domain antibodies; sdAb, VH/VHH) could aid in blocking virus replication, as these agents can traverse the virus- infected cell membranes (transbodies) and can interfere with the biological characteristics of the replicating virus proteins. Such examples include transbodies to the influenza virus, hepatitis C virus, Ebola virus, and dengue virus (206). Producing similar transbodies against intracellular proteins of coronaviruses, such as papain-like proteases (PLpro), cysteine-like protease (3CLpro), or other nsps, which are essential for replication and transcription of the virus, might formulate a practical move forward for a safer and potent passive immunization approach for virus-exposed persons and rendering therapy to infected patients.<br/>In a case study on five grimly sick patients having symptoms of severe pneumonia due to COVID-19, convalescent plasma administration was found to be helpful in patients recovering successfully. The convalescent plasma containing a SARS-CoV-2-specific ELISA (serum) antibody titer higher than 1:1,000 and neutralizing antibody titer more significant than 40 was collected from the recovered patients and used for plasma transfusion
