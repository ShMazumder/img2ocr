has the potential to infect humans. However, they<br/>may shed MERS-CoV through milk, urine, feces,<br/>and nasal and eye discharge and can also be found in<br/>the raw organs (108). In a study conducted to<br/>evaluate the susceptibility of animal species to<br/>MERS-CoV infection, llamas and pigs were found to<br/>be susceptible, indicating the possibility of MERS-<br/>CoV circulation in animal species other than<br/>dromedary camels (109).<br/><br/>Following the outbreak of SARS in China,<br/>SARS-CoV-like viruses were isolated from<br/>Himalayan palm civets (Paguma larvata) and<br/>raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) found in a<br/>live-animal market in Guangdong, China. The<br/>animal isolates obtained from the live-animal market<br/>retained a 29-nucleotide sequence that was not<br/>present in most of the human isolates (78). These<br/>findings were critical in identifying the possibility of<br/>interspecies transmission in SARS-CoV. The higher<br/>diversity and prevalence of bat coronaviruses in this<br/>region compared to those in previous reports indicate<br/>a host/pathogen coevolution. SARS -like<br/>coronaviruses also have been found circulating in the<br/>Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus _ sinicus)<br/>populations. The in vitro and in vivo studies carried
