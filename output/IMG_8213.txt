identify animals actively excreting MERS-CoV that
has the potential to infect humans. However, they
may shed MERS-CoV through milk, urine, feces,
and nasal and eye discharge and can also be found in
the raw organs (108). In a study conducted to
evaluate the susceptibility of animal species to
MERS-CoV infection, llamas and pigs were found to
be susceptible, indicating the possibility of MERS-
CoV circulation in animal species other than
dromedary camels (109).

Following the outbreak of SARS in China,
SARS-CoV-like viruses were isolated from
Himalayan palm civets (Paguma larvata) and
raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) found in a
live-animal market in Guangdong, China. The
animal isolates obtained from the live-animal market
retained a 29-nucleotide sequence that was not
present in most of the human isolates (78). These
findings were critical in identifying the possibility of
interspecies transmission in SARS-CoV. The higher
diversity and prevalence of bat coronaviruses in this
region compared to those in previous reports indicate
a host/pathogen coevolution. SARS -like
coronaviruses also have been found circulating in the
Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus _ sinicus)
populations. The in vitro and in vivo studies carried
