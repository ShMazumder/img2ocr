epidemic progresses, commercial tests<br/><br/>will become available.<br/><br/>Other laboratory investigations are<br/>usually non specific. The white cell<br/>count is usually normal or low. There<br/>may be lymphopenia; a lymphocyte<br/>count <1000 has been associated with<br/>severe disease. The platelet count is<br/>usually normal or mildly low. The CRP<br/>and ESR are generally elevated but<br/>procalcitonin levels are usually<br/>normal. A high procalcitonin level may<br/>indicate a bacterial co-infection. The<br/>ALT/AST, prothrombin time, creatinine,<br/>D-dimer, CPK and LDH may be elevated<br/>and high levels are associated with<br/><br/>severe disease.<br/><br/>The chest X-ray (CXR) usually shows<br/>bilateral infiltrates but may be normal<br/>in early disease. The CT is more<br/>sensitive and specific. CT imaging<br/>generally shows infiltrates, ground<br/><br/>glass opacities and sub segmental
