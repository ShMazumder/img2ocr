(one amino acid difference) to that of SARS-CoV-2.<br/>A comparison of the genomes _ suggests<br/>recombination between pangolin-CoV-like viruses<br/>with the bat-CoV-RaTG13-like virus. All this<br/>suggests the potential of pangolins to act as the<br/>intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 (145).<br/>Human-wildlife interactions, which are<br/>increasing in the context of climate change (142), are<br/>further considered high risk and responsible for the<br/>emergence of SARS-CoV. COVID-19 is also<br/>suspected of having a similar mode of origin. Hence,<br/>to prevent the occurrence of another zoonotic<br/>spillover (1), exhaustive coordinated efforts are<br/>needed to identify the high-risk pathogens harbored<br/>by wild animal populations, conducting surveillance<br/>among the people who are susceptible to zoonotic<br/>spillover events (12), and to improve the biosecurity<br/>measures associated with the wildlife trade (146).<br/>The serological surveillance studies conducted in<br/>people living in proximity to bat caves had earlier<br/>identified the serological confirmation of SARS-<br/>related CoVs in humans. People living at the<br/>wildlife-human interface, mainly in rural China, are<br/>regularly exposed to SARS-related CoVs (147).<br/>These findings will not have any significance until a
