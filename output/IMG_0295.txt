In fact,<br/>abnormal CT scans have been used to<br/>diagnose COVID-19 in suspect cases<br/>with negative molecular diagnosis;<br/>many of these patients had positive<br/><br/>molecular tests on repeat testing [22].<br/><br/>Differential Diagnosis [21]<br/><br/>The differential diagnosis includes all<br/>types of respiratory viral infections<br/>[influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory<br/>syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus,<br/>human metapneumovirus, non COVID-<br/>19 coronavirus], atypical organisms<br/>(mycoplasma, chlamydia) and bacterial<br/>infections.
