The outbreak<br/>of the virus has confronted the world's<br/>economic, medical and public health<br/>infrastructure. Elderly and<br/>immunocompromised patients also are<br/>susceptible to the virus's mortal impacts.<br/>Currently, there is no documented cure for the<br/>virus and no vaccine has been created, although<br/>some treatment protocols have been promising.<br/>Therefore, the virus can be controlled with the<br/>appropriate prevention strategies. Also,<br/>attempts have to be made to formulate<br/>systematic strategies to prevent such future<br/>zoonotic outbreaks.
