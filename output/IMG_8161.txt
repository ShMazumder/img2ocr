be employed for SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.<br/>These possess benefits of easy accessibility and<br/>recognized pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic<br/>activities, stability, doses, and side effects (9).<br/>Repurposed drugs have been studied for treating<br/>CoV infections, like lopinavir/ritonavir, and<br/>interferon-1B revealed in vitro anti-MERS-CoV<br/>action. The in vivo experiment carried out in the<br/>nonhuman primate model of common marmosets<br/>treated with lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon beta<br/>showed superior protective results in treated animals<br/>than in the untreated ones (190). A combination of<br/>these drugs is being evaluated to treat MERS in<br/>humans (MIRACLE trial) (191). These two protease<br/>inhibitors (lopinavir and ritonavir), in combination<br/>with ribavirin, gave encouraging clinical outcomes in<br/>SARS patients, suggesting their therapeutic values<br/>(165). However, in the current scenario, due to the<br/>lack of specific therapeutic agents against SARS-<br/>CoV-2, hospitalized patients confirmed for the<br/>disease are given supportive care, like oxygen and<br/>fluid therapy, along with antibiotic therapy for<br/>managing secondary bacterial infections (192).<br/>Patients with novel coronavirus or COVID-19<br/>pneumonia who are mechanically ventilated often<br/><br/>; lati ,
