evaluate the progression of infection (291). In<br/>addition to all of the above findings, sequencing and<br/>phylogenetics are critical in the correct identification<br/>and confirmation of the causative viral agent and<br/>useful to establish relationships with previous<br/>isolates and sequences, as well as to know, especially<br/>during an epidemic, the nucleotide and amino acid<br/>mutations and the molecular divergence. The rapid<br/>development and implementation of diagnostic tests<br/>against emerging novel diseases like COVID-19<br/>pose significant challenges due to the lack of<br/>resources and logistical limitations associated with<br/>an outbreak (155).<br/><br/>SARS-CoV-2 infection can also be confirmed by<br/>isolation and culturing. The human airway epithelial<br/>cell culture was found to be useful in isolating<br/>SARS-CoV-2 (3). The efficient control of an<br/>outbreak depends on the rapid diagnosis of the<br/>disease. Recently, in response to the COVID-19<br/>outbreak, 1-step quantitative real-time reverse<br/>transcription-PCR assays were developed that detect<br/>the ORF1b and N regions of the SARS-CoV-2<br/>genome (156). That assay was found to achieve the<br/>rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2. Nucleic acid-based<br/>assays offer high accuracy in the diagnosis of SARS-
