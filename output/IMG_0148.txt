<br/>Epidemiology and Pathogenesis<br/>[10, 11]<br/><br/>All ages are susceptible. Infection is<br/>transmitted through large droplets<br/>generated during coughing and<br/>sneezing by symptomatic patients but<br/>can also occur from asymptomatic<br/>people and before onset of symptoms<br/>[9]. Studies have shown higher viral<br/>loads in the nasal cavity as compared<br/>to the throat with no difference in viral<br/>burden between symptomatic and<br/>asymptomatic people [12]. Patients can<br/>be infectious for as long as the<br/>symptoms last and even on clinical<br/>recovery. Some people may act as<br/>super spreaders; a UK citizen who<br/>attended a conference in Singapore<br/>infected 11 other people while staying<br/>in a resort in the French Alps and upon<br/>return to the UK [6].
