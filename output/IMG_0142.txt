THERAPY<br/><br/>Guo Yanhong, an official with the National<br/>Health Commission (NHC), stated that<br/>convalescent plasma therapy is a significant<br/>method for treating severe COVID-19 patients.<br/>Among the COVID-19 patients currently<br/>receiving convalescent plasma therapy in the<br/>virus-hit Wuhan, one has been discharged from<br/>hospital, as reported by Chinese science<br/>authorities on Monday, 17th February 2020 in<br/>Beijing. The first dose of convalescent plasma<br/>from a COVID-19 patient was collected on 1st<br/>and 9th February 2020 from a severely ill<br/>patient who was given treatment at a hospital in<br/>Jiangxia District in Wuhan. The presence of the<br/>virus in patients is minimised by the antibodies<br/>in the convalescent plasma. Guiqiang stated<br/>that donating plasma may cause minimal harm<br/>to the donor and that there is nothing to be<br/>worried about. Plasma donors must be cured<br/>patients and discharged from hospital. Only<br/>plasma is used, whereas red blood cells (RBC),<br/>white blood cells (WBC) and blood platelets are<br/>transfused back into the donor's body. Wang<br/>alleged that donor's plasma will totally improve<br/>to its initial state after one or 2 weeks from the<br/>day of plasma donation of around 200 to 300<br/><br/>millilitres.°' ——
