SARS-CoV-2.<br/><br/>There is a steady increase in the reports of<br/>COVID-19 in companion and wild animals around<br/>the world. Further studies are required to evaluate<br/>the potential of animals (especially companion<br/>animals) to serve as an efficient reservoir host that<br/>can further alter the dynamics of human-to-human<br/>transmission (330). To date, two pet dogs (Hong<br/>Kong) and four pet cats (one each from Belgium and<br/>Hong Kong, two from the United States) have tested<br/>positive for SARS-CoV-2 (335). The World<br/>Organization for Animal Health (OIE) has confirmed<br/>the diagnosis of COVID-19 in both dogs and cats<br/>due to human-to-animal transmission (331). The<br/>similarity observed in the gene sequence of SARS-<br/>CoV-2 from an infected pet owner and his dog<br/>further confirms the occurrence of human-to-animal<br/>transmission (333). Even though asymptomatic,<br/>feline species should be considered a_ potential<br/>transmission route from animals to humans (326).<br/>However, currently, there are no reports of SARS-<br/>CoV-2 transmission from felines to human beings.<br/>Based on the current evidence, we can conclude that<br/>cats are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and can get<br/>infected by human beings. However, evidence of cat-
