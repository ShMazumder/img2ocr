SARS-CoV-2.<br/>There is a steady increase in the reports of COVID-19 in companion and wild animals around the world. Further studies are required to evaluate the potential of animals (especially companion animals) to serve as an efficient reservoir host that can further alter the dynamics of human-to-human transmission (330). To date, two pet dogs (Hong Kong) and four pet cats (one each from Belgium and Hong Kong, two from the United States) have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (335). The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) has confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19 in both dogs and cats due to human-to-animal transmission (331). The similarity observed in the gene sequence of SARS- CoV-2 from an infected pet owner and his dog further confirms the occurrence of human-to-animal transmission (333). Even though asymptomatic, feline species should be considered a_ potential transmission route from animals to humans (326). However, currently, there are no reports of SARS- CoV-2 transmission from felines to human beings. Based on the current evidence, we can conclude that cats are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and can get infected by human beings. However, evidence of cat-
