treatment for MERS- and SARS-CoV infections, and<br/>the main focus in clinical settings remains on<br/>lessening clinical signs and providing supportive<br/>care (183-186). Effective drugs to manage COVID-<br/>19 patients include remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir<br/>alone or in a blend with interferon beta, convalescent<br/>plasma, and monoclonal antibodies (MAbs);<br/>however, efficacy and safety issues of these drugs<br/>require additional clinical trials (187, 281). A<br/>controlled trial of ritonavir-boosted lopinavir and<br/>interferon alpha 2b treatment was performed on<br/>COVID-19 hospitalized patients<br/>(ChiCTR2000029308) (188). In addition, the use of<br/>hydroxychloroquine and _ tocilizumab for their<br/>potential role in modulating inflammatory responses<br/>in the lungs and antiviral effect has been proposed<br/>and discussed in many research articles. Still, no<br/>fool-proof clinical trials have been published (194,<br/>196, 197, 261-272). Recently, a clinical trial<br/>conducted on adult patients suffering from severe<br/>COVID-19 revealed no benefit of lopinavir-ritonavir<br/>treatment over standard care (273).<br/><br/>The efforts to control SARS-CoV-2 infection<br/>utilize defined strategies as followed against MERS<br/>and SARS, along with adopting and strengthening a
