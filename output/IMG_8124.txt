COVID-19 (209). The later stages of coronavirus-<br/>induced inflammatory cascades are characterized by<br/>the release of proinflammatory interleukin-1 (IL-1)<br/>family members, such as IL-1 and IL-33. Hence,<br/>there exists a possibility that the inflammation<br/>associated with coronavirus can be inhibited by<br/>utilizing anti-inflammatory cytokines that belong to<br/>the IL-1 family (92). It has also been suggested that<br/>the actin protein is the host factor that is involved in<br/>cell entry and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Hence,<br/>those drugs that modulate the biological activity of<br/>this protein, like ibuprofen, might have some<br/>therapeutic application in managing the disease<br/>(174). The plasma angiotensin 2 level was found to<br/>be markedly elevated in COVID-19 infection and<br/>was correlated with viral load and lung injury.<br/>Hence, drugs that block angiotensin receptors may<br/>have potential for treating COVID-19 infection<br/>(121). A scientist from Germany, named Rolf<br/>Hilgenfeld, has been working on the identification of<br/>drugs for the treatment of coronaviral infection since<br/>the time of the first SARS outbreak (19).<br/><br/>The SARS-CoV S2 subunit has a significant<br/>function in mediating virus fusion that provides entry<br/>into the host cell. Heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and heptad
