wild animals to humans during SARS and MERS<br/>outbreaks (79, 102). The possibility of crossing the<br/>species barrier for the third time has also been<br/>suspected in the case of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19).<br/>Bats are recognized as a possible natural reservoir<br/>host of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection.<br/>In contrast, the possible intermediary host is the<br/>palm civet for SARS-CoV and the dromedary camel<br/>for MERS-CoV infection (102). Bats are considered<br/>the ancestral hosts for both SARS and MERS (103).<br/>Bats are also considered the reservoir host of human<br/>coronaviruses like HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63<br/>(104). In the case of COVID-19, there are two<br/>possibilities for primary transmission: it can be<br/>transmitted either through intermediate hosts, similar<br/>to that of SARS and MERS, or directly from bats<br/>(103). The emergence paradigm put forward in the<br/>SARS outbreak suggests that SARS-CoV originated<br/>from bats (reservoir host) and later jumped to civets<br/>(intermediate host) and incorporated changes within<br/>the receptor-binding domain (RBD) to improve<br/>binding to civet ACE2. This civet-adapted virus,<br/>during their subsequent exposure to humans at live<br/>markets, promoted further adaptations that resulted<br/>in the epidemic strain (104). Transmission can also
