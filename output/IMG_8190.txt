uninfected patients and health care workers (289).<br/>Recently, it was found that the anal swabs gave more<br/>positive results than oral swabs in the later stages of<br/>infection (153). Hence, clinicians have to be cautious<br/>while discharging any COVID-19-infected patient<br/>based on negative oral swab test results due to the<br/>possibility of fecal-oral transmission. Even though<br/>the viral loads in stool samples were found to be less<br/>than those of respiratory samples, _ strict<br/>precautionary measures have to be followed while<br/>handling stool samples of COVID-19 suspected or<br/>infected patients (151). Children infected with<br/>SARS-CoV-2 experience only a mild form of illness<br/>and recover immediately after treatment. It was<br/>recently found that stool samples of SARS-CoV-2-<br/>infected children that gave negative throat swab<br/>results were positive within ten days of negative<br/>results. This could result in the  fecal-oral<br/>transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infections, especially<br/>in children (290). Hence, to prevent the fecal-oral<br/>transmission of SARS-CoV-2, infected COVID-19<br/>patients should only be considered negative when<br/>they test negative for SARS-CoV-2 in the stool<br/>sample.
