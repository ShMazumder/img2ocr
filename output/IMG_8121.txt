on its ability to provide protection not only against<br/>present versions of the virus but also the ones that<br/>are likely to emerge in the future. This can be<br/>achieved by identifying antibodies that can recognize<br/>relatively conserved epitopes that are maintained as<br/>such even after the occurrence of considerable<br/>variations (362). Even though several vaccine<br/>clinical trials are being conducted around the world,<br/>pregnant women have been completely excluded<br/>from these studies. Pregnant women are highly<br/>vulnerable to emerging diseases such as COVID-19<br/>due to alterations in the immune system and other<br/>physiological systems that are associated with<br/>pregnancy. Therefore, in the event of successful<br/>vaccine development, pregnant women will not get<br/>access to the vaccines (361). Hence, it is<br/>recommended that pregnant women be included in<br/>the ongoing vaccine trials, since successful<br/>vaccination in pregnancy will protect the mother,<br/>fetus, and newborn.<br/><br/>The heterologous immune effects induced by<br/>Bacillus Calmette Gu√©rin (BCG) vaccination is a<br/>promising strategy for controlling the COVID-19<br/>pandemic and requires further investigations. BCG is<br/>a widely used vaccine against tuberculosis in high-
