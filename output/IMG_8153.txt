Analysis of the initial cluster of infections suggests<br/>that the infected individuals had a common exposure<br/>point, a seafood market in Wuhan, Hubei Province,<br/>China (Fig. 6). The restaurants of this market are<br/>well-known for providing different types of wild<br/>animals for human consumption (71). The Huanan<br/>South China Seafood Market also sells live animals,<br/>such as poultry, bats, snakes, and marmots (72). This<br/>might be the point where zoonotic (animal-to-<br/>human) transmission occurred (71). Although<br/>SARS-CoV-2 is alleged to have originated from an<br/>animal host (zoonotic origin) with further human-to-<br/>human transmission (Fig. 6), the likelihood of<br/>foodborne transmission should be ruled out with<br/>further investigations, since it is a latent possibility<br/>(1). Additionally, other potential and expected routes<br/>would be associated with transmission, as in other<br/>respiratory viruses, by direct contact, such as shaking<br/>contaminated hands, or by direct contact with<br/>contaminated surfaces (Fig. 6). Still, whether blood<br/>transfusion and organ transplantation (276), as well<br/>as transplacental and perinatal routes, are possible<br/>routes for SARS-CoV-2 transmission needs to be<br/>determined (Fig. 6).
