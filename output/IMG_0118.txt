significantly higher than the initial WHO estimate of<br/>1.4 to 2.5 (77). It is too early to obtain the exact Ro<br/>value, since there is a possibility of bias due to<br/>insufficient data. The higher Ro value is indicative of<br/>the more significant potential of SARS-CoV-2<br/>transmission in a susceptible population. This is not<br/>the first time where the culinary practices of China<br/>have been blamed for the origin of novel coronavirus<br/>infection in humans. Previously, the animals present<br/>in the live-animal market were identified to be the<br/>intermediate hosts of the SARS outbreak in China<br/>(78). Several wildlife species were found to harbor<br/>potentially evolving coronavirus strains that can<br/>overcome the species barrier (79). One of the main<br/>principles of Chinese food culture is that live-<br/>slaughtered animals are considered more nutritious<br/>(5).<br/><br/>After 4 months of struggle that lasted from<br/>December 2019 to March 2020, the COVID-19<br/>situation now seems under control in China. The wet<br/>animal markets have reopened, and people have<br/>started buying bats, dogs, cats, birds, scorpions,<br/>badgers, rabbits, pangolins (scaly anteaters), minks,<br/>soup from palm civet, ostriches, hamsters, snapping<br/>turtles, ducks, fish, Siamese crocodiles, and other
