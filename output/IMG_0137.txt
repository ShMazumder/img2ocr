of atypical clinical manifestations to avoid the<br/>possibility of missed diagnosis. The early<br/>transmission ability of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be<br/>similar to or slightly higher than that of SARS-CoV,<br/>reflecting that it could be controlled despite<br/>moderate to high transmissibility (84).<br/><br/>Increasing reports of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage and<br/>wastewater warrants the need for further<br/>investigation due to the possibility of fecal-oral<br/>transmission. SARS-CoV-2 present in environmental<br/>compartments such as soil and water will finally end<br/>up in the wastewater and sewage sludge of treatment<br/>plants (328). Therefore, we have to reevaluate the<br/>current wastewater and sewage sludge treatment<br/>procedures and introduce advanced techniques that<br/>are specific and effective against SARS-CoV-2.<br/>Since there is active shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in the<br/>stool, the prevalence of infections in a large<br/>population can be studied using wastewater-based<br/>epidemiology. Recently, reverse  transcription-<br/>quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to enumerate<br/>the copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrated from<br/>wastewater collected from a wastewater treatment<br/>plant (327). The calculated viral RNA copy numbers<br/>determine the number of infected individuals. The<br/><br/>nr e nr
