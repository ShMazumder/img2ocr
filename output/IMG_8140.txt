chloroquine, tested in comparison to remdesivir and<br/>favipiravir (broad-spectrum antiviral drugs) revealed<br/>remdesivir and chloroquine to be highly effective<br/>against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro (194).<br/>Ribavirin, penciclovir, and favipiravir might not<br/>possess noteworthy in vivo antiviral actions for<br/>SARS-CoV-2, since higher concentrations of these<br/>nucleoside analogs are needed in vitro to lessen the<br/>viral infection. Both remdesivir and chloroquine are<br/>being used in humans to treat other diseases, and<br/>such safer drugs can be explored for assessing their<br/>effectiveness in COVID-19 patients.<br/><br/>Several therapeutic agents, such as<br/>lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine, and<br/>hydroxychloroquine, have been proposed for the<br/>clinical management of COVID-19 (299). A<br/>molecular docking study, conducted in the RNA-<br/>dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2<br/>using different commercially available<br/>antipolymerase drugs, identified that drugs such as<br/>ribavirin, remdesivir, galidesivir, tenofovir, and<br/>sofosbuvir bind RdRp tightly, indicating their vast<br/>potential to be used against COVID-19 (305). A<br/>broad-spectrum antiviral drug that was developed in<br/>the United States, tilorone dihydrochloride (tilorone),
